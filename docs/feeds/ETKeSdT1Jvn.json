Andrew and his team have been on a journey over the last 12 months to take their portfolio of circa 10 Machine Learning models in production and migrate them from an on-prem solution to a cloud-based environment. During the podcast, Andrew shares his reflections as well as some dos (and don’ts!) of managing the migration of an established portfolio.\n\n// Bio\nMichelle Marie Conway\nMichelle is a Lead Data Scientist in the high-performance data science team at Lloyds Banking Group. With deep expertise in managing production-level Python code and machine learning models, she has worked alongside fellow senior manager Andrew to drive the bank's transition to the Google Cloud Platform. Together, they have played a pivotal role in modernising the ML portfolio in collaboration with a remarkable ML Ops team.\n\nOriginally from Ireland and now based in London, Michelle blends her technical expertise with a love for the arts. \n\nAndrew Baker\nAndrew graduated from the University of Birmingham with a first-class honours degree in Mathematics and Music with a Year in Computer Science and joined Lloyds Banking Group on their Retail graduate scheme in 2015.\n\nSince 2021 Andrew has worked in the world of data, firstly in shaping the Retail data strategy and most recently as a Data Science Delivery Lead, growing and managing a team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. He has built a high-performing team responsible for building and maintaining ML models in production for the Consumer Lending division of the bank.\n\nAndrew is motivated by the role that data science and ML can play in transforming the business and its processes, and is focused on balancing the power of ML with the need for simplicity and explainability that enables business users to engage with the opportunities that exist in this space and the demands of a highly regulated environment.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\nhttps://shop.mlops.community/\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: https://www.michelleconway.co.uk/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-intelligence-just-when-data-science-answer-andrew-baker-hfdge/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-intelligence-conundrum-generative-ai-andrew-baker-qla7e/ \n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slack\nFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunity\nSign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/register\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\nConnect with Michelle on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle--conway/\nConnect with Andrew on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-baker-90952289\n\n</p>\n</ituneshack>",

With London-born tour guide David Charnick, they slip down hidden alleyways to find the old debtor's prison that the Dickens family once called home; a place that haunted a young Charles for the rest of his life. They find the old counting houses and graveyards that inspired the creation of Ebenezer Scrooge and the locations that appear in <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. With David's masterful guidance and atmospheric readings, this immersive episode takes you to the fireside of a London coaching inn as the sun sets outside on a late December afternoon.</p><br><p>A warning: this episode contains references to historical suicides.</p><br><p>Dickens' extracts are read by Robyn Wilson.</p><br><p>Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore.</p></ituneshack>",

Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience.

He believes firmly in open-source, having spent 12 years accruing over 1000 academic citations building open-source software in domains such as machine learning, image analysis, and coupled physical processes. He received his Ph.D. from Université Grenoble Alpes, France, in computational mechanics.\n\nUnleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.\n\n// Abstract\nIndexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.\n\nThe latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications.
