      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: China's commerce ministry has proposed export restrictions on some technology used to make battery components and process critical minerals lithium and gallium, a document, opens new tab issued on Thursday showed. If implemented, they would be the latest in a series of export restrictions and bans targeting critical minerals and the technology used to process them, areas in which Beijing is globally dominant. Their announcement precedes the inauguration later this month of Donald Trump for a second term during which he is expected to use tariffs and various trade restrictions against other countries, in particular China. [...]\n \nThe proposed expansion and revisions of restrictions on technology used to extract and process lithium or prepare battery components could also hinder the overseas expansion plans of major Chinese battery makers, including CATL, Gotion, and EVE Energy. Some technologies to extract gallium would also be restricted. Thursday's announcement does not say when the proposed changes, which are open for public comment until Feb. 1, could come into force. Adam Webb, head of battery raw materials at consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, notes that China retains a 70% grip on the global processing of lithium into the material needed to make EV batteries. \"These proposed measures would be a move to maintain this high market share and to secure lithium chemical production for China's domestic battery supply chains,\" he said. \"Depending on the level of export restrictions imposed, this could pose challenges for Western lithium producers hoping to use Chinese technology to produce lithium chemicals.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=China+Proposes+Further+Export+Curbs+On+Battery%2C+Critical+Minerals+Tech%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F223226%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F223226%2Fchina-proposes-further-export-curbs-on-battery-critical-minerals-tech%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/223226/china-proposes-further-export-curbs-on-battery-critical-minerals-tech?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568429&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Following the news, Getty's shares were up 20.3% in afternoon trading, while shares of Shutterstock were up 7.7%. Reuters reports: The development comes at a time when Getty Images has struggled to retain customers and replace the lost customers. Its creative and editorial products, two of its largest revenue segments, declined year-over-year in 2023, according to its annual report. The decline in the popularity of stock image websites has coincided with the rise of AI tools like Midjourney and DALL-E 2, which can generate unique images quickly and cheaply. Seattle, Washington-based Getty is considering how to structure a deal that would unite two of the biggest U.S. providers of licensed visual content, the report said.

      "content": "Windows 11 24H2 continues to experience issues with multifunction devices using the eSCL scan protocol, despite Microsoft marking the problem as resolved. According to a Register reader, \"It works on a Windows 10 machine, but not on Windows 11, unless both the computer and the scanner are on wired Ethernet.\" From the report: Microsoft issued a compatibility safeguard hold on USB-connected devices using the Scanner Communication Language (eSCL) protocol in November after users who installed the Windows update experienced glitches with device discovery. The issue was reported resolved by Microsoft in December. However, it seems that KB5048667 might not have fixed all the problems for Canon owners. According to our reader: \"Canon support tells me that the 24H2 eSCL issue still is not fixed.\" We asked Microsoft about the situation, but despite telling us it was looking into the problem on Friday, December 20, the company has yet to provide any further details. Canon was more forthcoming. A spokesperson told The Register it was aware of a problem impacting devices using ScanGear MF.\n \nScanGear MF is a scanner driver provided by Canon and allows customers to configure advanced settings for scanning. Canon does not appear to be changing its code to rectify whatever problems had been brought on by the Windows 11 update. The spokesperson said: \"Microsoft is currently working on an OS amendment to resolve this and we are keeping in close contact with them. The timing for resolving this is yet to be confirmed by Microsoft, however we expect to receive the plan to fix in January 2025.\" Customers affected by the issue, which manifests itself with a communications error message, according to Canon's support forum, are advised to use either native Microsoft software solutions or go fully wired via USB.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=A+New+Year's+Gift+From+Microsoft%3A+Surprise%2C+Your+Scanners+Don't+Work%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2137202%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2137202%2Fa-new-years-gift-from-microsoft-surprise-your-scanners-dont-work%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/2137202/a-new-years-gift-from-microsoft-surprise-your-scanners-dont-work?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568413&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

The new format \"could eventually serve as a free alternative to Dolby Atmos, the dominant 3D audio format that hardware makers like Samsung pay to license for TVs and other equipment,\" reports The Verge. \"Samsung says that similar to Atmos, this audio format supports adjusting 'audio data such as the location and intensity of sounds, along with spatial reflections' to create a 3D experience.\" From the report: The two companies first announced a partnership to develop spatial audio technology in 2023, initially calling it Immersive Audio Model and Formats (IAMF). At the time, Samsung spatial audio head WooHyun Nam said the format would provide \"a complete open-source framework for 3D audio, from creation to delivery and playback.\"\n \nThe IAMF spec has also been adopted by the Alliance for Open Media, a group that has been pushing for royalty-free codec support since 2015 and counts companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Netflix -- along with Samsung and Google -- among its members. If they also add support for this audio format, it could help it catch on, although it's already taken years for their AV1 video codec to see more use. Samsung and Google are also creating a certification program with the Telecommunications Technology Association \"to ensure consistent audio quality\" across devices using the format, which also sounds similar to the way companies like Dolby and THX manage the labeling for their specs.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Samsung+and+Google's+New+Spatial+Audio+Format+Will+Take+On+Dolby+Atmos%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2127241%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2127241%2Fsamsung-and-googles-new-spatial-audio-format-will-take-on-dolby-atmos%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/2127241/samsung-and-googles-new-spatial-audio-format-will-take-on-dolby-atmos?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568399&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Rolling Stone: Sun pours through the lush foliage of a jungle, bleaching the pale limestone as a rotting man stands in the center of an otherwise empty arena, his yellow eyes leering from beneath a fringe of limp, blonde hair. Positioned around the edge are a hundred bodies, Orcs and Trolls and bipedal oxen shouting, demanding, the death of the dishonorable. Their voices swell into a cacophony of noise before one rings out above the rest, howling, 'Kill the cheater and you'll get 20 gold!' There is silence, and then another frenzy. As I watch, eyes fixed on the dim glow of a laptop screen, I think of the colosseum in Rome -- sweat running down the muscled arms of battle-tested gladiators, the crowd cheering for blood.\n \nThis might sound like a moment pulled from a high fantasy drama made for prestige TV, but this is World of Warcraft, a now 20-year old online RPG. Instead of actors parading in front of green screens, this story's cast are streamers that occupy a virtual world. Tensions are high not because they're scripted, but because in World of Warcraft's Hardcore mode, death is permanent. Dejected, though acknowledging the transgression made, Sequisha -- the streamer who was promptly executed for cheating -- sighs, and goes back to the character select screen. He creates a new avatar; it's time to start the game all over again.\n \nSequisha's execution and subsequent reincarnation is just one of hundreds of stories playing out everyday in World of Warcraft as streamers have flocked to the massively multiplayer online RPG (MMORPG) to play together. Through their strife, and a commitment to staying in-character via roleplay, groups like the guild OnlyFangs have turned World of Warcraft into an RPG within an RPG, playing out improvisational personal drama where the stakes are high. In Hardcore mode, World of Warcraft has become the best soap opera on the internet, all playing out across over dozens of OnlyFangs creator streams every day. The new \"Classic\" and \"Hardcore\" servers were launched in celebration of World of Warcraft's 20th anniversary, helping to reignite interest in the game and increase viewership on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. The Hardcore server, where character death is permanent, attracted top streamers, leading to the formation of guilds like OnlyFangs.\n \nAfter a successful first season, OnlyFangs reshuffled its roster, embracing a more immersive roleplaying approach in its second season. \"What they didn't know was their experiment in World of Warcraft roleplay would inadvertently create one of the best emergent dramas on the internet,\" reports Rolling Stone.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OnlyFangs+Has+Made+'World+of+Warcraft'+Into+Twitch's+Best+Soap+Opera%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgames.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2117202%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgames.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2117202%2Fonlyfangs-has-made-world-of-warcraft-into-twitchs-best-soap-opera%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://games.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/2117202/onlyfangs-has-made-world-of-warcraft-into-twitchs-best-soap-opera?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568397&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Originally launched by the firm Canonical in 2013, it was later passed to UBports in 2017 after Canonical discontinued support. Primarily designed for smartphones and tablets, <strong>Ubuntu Touch is unique for its \"convergence\" feature, which aims to extend the mobile experience to desktops and TVs.</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nWhile its primary focus remains mobile, it also offers an innovative experience by transforming a phone into a desktop when connected to a monitor.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-01-03T21:54:12.199Z-p0ionpxocjvywkgu97ygwm1k\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAnother standout feature of <strong><a href=\"https://ubuntu-touch.io/\">Ubuntu Touch</a></strong> is its emphasis on user control and privacy. It provides a pre-installed suite of essential apps and allows easy multitasking through gestures, offering a smooth, ad-free experience. The system also incorporates Libertine, a feature that enables users to run traditional Linux desktop applications on their devices. Ubuntu Touch’s interface is powered by Qt, designed to be intuitive and easily navigable.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe community releases periodic updates, keeping the OS adaptable and secure. In recent years, support has been extended to newer devices like the PinePhone, providing users with an alternative to Android and iOS backed by a committed open-source community. </p>\n<p>\\\nUBports, a non-profit foundation, funds Ubuntu Touch through community donations, sponsorships, and an online shop.

This is a result of new AI features like Genmoji, ChatGPT in Siri, and Image Playground. With further updates expected, storage demands could rise to 10GB per device. 9to5Mac reports: Per Apple's website, Apple Intelligence now requires 7GB of free storage. The same 7GB number applies whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. But it also, since each product does its own on-device processing, adds up for multi-device use. If you want to use AI features across all three devices (which I'd assume most of us do), that's a grand total of 21GB of free space being used by Apple Intelligence. And unfortunately, if you're tight on storage, there's no way to reduce the requirement by disabling certain features.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Apple+Intelligence+Now+Requires+Nearly+Double+the+iPhone+Storage%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2048247%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2048247%2Fapple-intelligence-now-requires-nearly-double-the-iphone-storage%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/2048247/apple-intelligence-now-requires-nearly-double-the-iphone-storage?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568353&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>In the <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/home-assistant/3/\">previous post</a> of this focus, we replaced Philips Hue automation with the one from Home Assistant. One significant gap we noticed was that Home Assistant doesn't automatically adjust the brightness according to the time of the day, a feature Philips Hue offers. In this post, we are going to address this gap.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe first step when wanting to add a feature to Home Assistant is to browse through available integrations. While there was no out-of-the-box integration, I discovered an alternative: HACS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thehomeassistantcommunitystore\">The Home Assistant Community Store</h2>\n<p>Before implementing your integration, you should know about <a href=\"https://hacs.xyz/\">Home Assistant Community Store</a> or HACS. HACS is a <strong>third-party integration store</strong>. If Home Assistant doesn't offer the necessary integration, there's a considerable chance somebody published it on HACS.</p>\n<p>\\\nHACS itself is available as an integration.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ySK5UmEKUigi6gZlUx5UYDhUNhk1-bg02leu.jpeg\" alt=\"Search for HACS\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOnce you install it, it appears in the integration list.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ySK5UmEKUigi6gZlUx5UYDhUNhk1-9p12lok.jpeg\" alt=\"HAC installed\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOn HACS, we can search for a relevant integration. Indeed, there's <a href=\"https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting\">Adaptive Lighting</a>:</p>\n<h3 id=\"adaptivelighting\">Adaptive Lighting</h3>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Adaptive Lighting is a custom component for Home Assistant that intelligently adjusts the brightness and color of your lights 💡 based on the sun's position, while still allowing for manual control.</p>\n  <p>\\\n  -- <a href=\"https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting\">GitHub - Adaptive Lighting</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nThe original app allowed the light to be configured according to time ranges. Adaptive Lighting is head and shoulders above that: it takes into account sunrise and sunset time. Even better, it provides an <a href=\"https://basnijholt.github.io/adaptive-lighting/\">app</a> for configuration.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ySK5UmEKUigi6gZlUx5UYDhUNhk1-b722lck.jpeg\" alt=\"Adaptive Lighting companion webapp\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTo add any repository to HACS, click on the <em>HACS > Integrations</em> item on the main left menu. Then, click on the bottom right <em>Explore and download repositories</em> button. Add the <a href=\"https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting\">Adaptive Lighting</a> repo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ySK5UmEKUigi6gZlUx5UYDhUNhk1-6d32lwq.jpeg\" alt=\"Adaptive Lighting added to HACS\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nHome Assistant features the Adaptive Lighting integration at this stage, ready to be configured and used.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ySK5UmEKUigi6gZlUx5UYDhUNhk1-gw42lry.jpeg\" alt=\"Adaptive Lighting integration\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nWe can now add a new entry. Click on the <em>Add Entry</em> button. Name it accordingly. Once the service is created, click the <em>Configure</em> button.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ySK5UmEKUigi6gZlUx5UYDhUNhk1-w652lr2.jpeg\" alt=\"Configure the Adaptive Lighting service\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe configuration can be quite intimidating, with its many parameters. You can use the companion app mentioned above to help you with it. I kept all parameters to their default value, but the most important one: the light is to adapt according to the time of the day.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ySK5UmEKUigi6gZlUx5UYDhUNhk1-mb62l4b.jpeg\" alt=\"Adaptive Lighting configured service\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nDepending on your setup, you can configure a single light, a couple of them, or all. I added only a single one, the one managed by the sensor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this post, we configured the Adaptive Lighting integration to our Home Assistant. We can now benefit from different intensities based on the time of the day.</p>\n<p>\\\nEven better, we learned to search the HACS when we didn't find the relevant out-of-the-box integration.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>To go further:</strong></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">Home Assistant</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hacs.xyz/\">Home Assistant Community Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting\">Adaptive Lighting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/home-assistant/3/\">Replace Philips Hue automation with Home Assistant's</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/home-assistant/4/\">A Java Geek</a> on December 22nd, 2024</em></p>",

Single View Reconstruction</h2>\n<p>We evaluate the quality of the reconstructed geometry of different methods. The quantitative results are summarized in Table 1, and the qualitative comparisons are presented in Fig. 6. Shap-E [25] tends to produce incomplete and distorted meshes. SyncDreamer [33] generates shapes that are roughly aligned with the input image but lack detailed geometries, and the texture quality is subpar. One-2-3- 45 [30] attempts to reconstruct meshes from the multiviewinconsistent outputs of Zero123 [31]. While it can capture coarse geometries, it loses important details in the process. In comparison, our method stands out by achieving the highest reconstruction quality, both in terms of geometry and textures.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-hr83xo5.png\" alt=\"Table 2.

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: A U.S. online gift card store has secured an online storage server that was publicly exposing hundreds of thousands of customer government-issued identity documents to the internet. A security researcher, who goes by the online handle JayeLTee, found the publicly exposed storage server late last year containing driving licenses, passports, and other identity documents belonging to MyGiftCardSupply, a company that sells digital gift cards for customers to redeem at popular brands and online services.\n \nMyGiftCardSupply's website says it requires customers to upload a copy of their identity documents as part of its compliance efforts with U.S. anti-money laundering rules, often known as \"know your customer\" checks, or KYC. But the storage server containing the files had no password, allowing anyone on the internet to access the data stored inside. JayeLTee alerted TechCrunch to the exposure last week after MyGiftCardSupply did not respond to the researcher's email about the exposed data. [...]\n \nAccording to JayeLTee, the exposed data -- hosted on Microsoft's Azure cloud -- contained over 600,000 front and back images of identity documents and selfie photos of around 200,000 customers. It's not uncommon for companies subject to KYC checks to ask their customers to take a selfie while holding a copy of their identity documents to verify that the customer is who they say they are, and to weed out forgeries. MyGiftCardSupply founder Sam Gastro told TechCrunch: \"The files are now secure, and we are doing a full audit of the KYC verification procedure. Going forward, we are going to delete the files promptly after doing the identity verification.\" It's not known how long the data was exposed or if the company would commit to notifying affected individuals.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Online+Gift+Card+Store+Exposed+Hundreds+of+Thousands+of+People's+Identity+Documents%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2043212%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F2043212%2Fonline-gift-card-store-exposed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-peoples-identity-documents%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/2043212/online-gift-card-store-exposed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-peoples-identity-documents?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568351&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

In this paper, we present Wonder3D, an innovative approach designed for efficiently generating high10 fidelity textured meshes from single-view images. When provided with a single image, Wonder3D initiates the process by generating consistent multi-view normal maps and paired color images. Subsequently, it utilizes a novel normal fusion algorithm to extract highly-detailed geometries from these multi-view 2D representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method upholds good efficiency and robust generalization, and delivers high-quality geometry.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Future Works</strong>. While Wonder3D has demonstrated promising performance in reconstructing 3D geometry from single-view images, there are still some limitations that the current framework does not fully address. First, the current implementation of Wonder3D only produces normals and color images from six views. This limited number of views makes it challenging for our method to accurately reconstruct objects with very thin structures and severe occlusions. Additionally, expanding Wonder3D to incorporate more views would demand increased computational resources during training. To address this issue, Wonder3D may benefit from leveraging more efficient multi-view attention mechanisms to handle a greater number of views effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Thanks for the GPU support from VAST, the valuable suggestions from Wei Yin, the help in data rendering from Dehu Wang.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<p>[1] Titas Anciukevicius, Zexiang Xu, Matthew Fisher, Paul Hen- ˇ derson, Hakan Bilen, Niloy J Mitra, and Paul Guerrero.

Novel View Synthesis</h2>\n<p>We evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis for different methods. The quantitative results are presented in Table 2, and the qualitative results can be found in Figure 3. Zero123 [31] produces visually reasonable images, but they lack multi-view consistency since it operates on each view independently. Although SyncDreamer [31] introduces a volume attention scheme to enhance the consistency of multi-view images, their model is sensitive to the elevation degrees of the input images and tends to produce unreasonable results. In contrast, our method is capable of generating images that not only exhibit semantic consistency with the input image but also maintain a high degree of consistency across multiple views in terms of both colors and geometry</p>\n<h2 id=\"56discussions\">5.6. Discussions</h2>\n<p>In this section, we conduct a set of studies to verify the effectiveness of our designs as well as the properties of the method.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-z183xqd.png\" alt=\"Figure 9. Ablation study on multi-view attention.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Cross-Domain Diffusion.</strong> To validate the effectiveness of our proposed cross-domain diffusion scheme, we study the following settings: (a) cross-domain model with cross-domain attention; (b) cross-domain model without cross-domain attention; (c) sequential model rgb-to-normal: first train a multi-view color diffusion model then train a multiview normal diffusion model conditioned on the previously generated color images; (d) sequential model normal-torgb: first train a multi-view normal diffusion model then train a multi-view color diffusion model conditioned on the previously generated normal images.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs shown in (a) and (b) of Figure 7, it’s evident that the cross-domain attentions significantly enhance the consistency between color images and normals, particularly in terms of the detailed geometries of objects like the icecream and Pharaoh sculpture. From (c) and (d) of Figure 7, while the normals and color images generated by sequential models maintain some consistency, their results suffer from performance drops.</p>\n<p>\\\nperformance drops. For the sequential model rgb-to-normal, conditioning on the separately generated normal maps, the generated color images exhibit color aberrations in comparison to the input image, as shown in (c) of Figure 7. Conversely, for the sequential model normal-to-rgb, conditioning on the separately generated color images, the normal maps give unreasonable geometry, as illustrated in (d) of Figure 7. These experiments demonstrate that jointly predicting normal maps and color images through the cross-domain attention mechanism can facilitate a comprehensive perception of information from different domains. We also speculate that in the context of sequential models, the generated color images or normal maps of stage 1 may exhibit a minor domain gap to the ground truth data trained in stage 2. Therefore, compared to sequential prediction, the cross-domain approach proves to be more effective in enhancing the quality of each domain as well as the overall prediction</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-jv93xhh.png\" alt=\"Figure 10. The qualitative results of Wonder3D on various animal objects.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Multi-view Consistency.</strong> We conducted an analysis of the effectiveness of the multi-view attention mechanism, as illustrated in Figure 9. Our findings show that the multi-view attention greatly enhances the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view images, particularly for the rear views. In the absence of the multi-view attention, the color images of the rear views exhibited unrealistic predictions.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Normal Fusion.</strong> To assess the efficacy of our normal fusion algorithm, we conducted experiments using the complex lion model, which is rich in geometric details, as illustrated in Figure 8. The baseline model’s surfaces exhibited numerous holes and noises. Utilizing either the geometry-aware normal loss or the outlier-dropping loss helps mitigate the noisy surfaces. Finally, combining both strategies yields the best performance, resulting in clean surfaces while preserving detailed geometries.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Generalization.</strong> To demonstrate the generalization capability of our method, we conducted evaluations using diverse image styles, including sketches, cartoons, and images of animals, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 10. Despite variations in lighting effects and geometric complexities among these images, our method consistently generated multi-view normal maps and color images, ultimately yielding high-quality geometries.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15008\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Xiaoxiao Long, The University of Hong Kong, VAST, MPI Informatik and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(2) Yuan-Chen Guo, Tsinghua University, VAST and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(3) Cheng Lin, The University of Hong Kong with Corresponding authors;</p>\n<p>(4) Yuan Liu, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(5) Zhiyang Dou, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(6) Lingjie Liu, University of Pennsylvania;</p>\n<p>(7) Yuexin Ma, Shanghai Tech University;</p>\n<p>(8) Song-Hai Zhang, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(9) Marc Habermann, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(10) Christian Theobalt, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(11) Wenping Wang, Texas A&amp;M University with Corresponding authors.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

      "content": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The intelligent search results has become an absolute part of information retrieval in the digital world. Classic keyword-based search engines generally do not account for the actual user's intent or context, leading to missed opportunity and lost revenue, for online companies. Alternatively, Hybrid Search which combines keyword-based and AI-driven semantic search enhances your existing search capabilities in just a few minutes.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis step-by-step guide will show you how to elevate your search functionality using an open-source project, <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/\">OpenSearch</a>. By adopting these steps, you can turn your search into a complete, working, artificial intelligence solution in 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"1whatishybridsearchandwhydoesitmatter\">1. What is Hybrid Search and Why Does It Matter?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/hybrid-search/\">Hybrid Search</a> combines:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Keyword-based search:</strong> Classic Boolean and text-based approaches to searching (e.g., \"bag\" results that contain the word \"bag\").</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Semantic or vector-based search:</strong> AI techniques that comprehend context (e.g., “backpack” also retrieves “knapsack”, “school bag” etc., as the search engine recognizes their similarity).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nCombining these two paradigms, you offer users not only relevance but performance and context-sensitive answers. In the e-commerce domain, this is to present users with exact items they are searching even if they express themselves in a different way. For content searches, it ensures that the most contextually relevant documents appear first.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"2prerequisites\">2. Prerequisites</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Docker (recommended for a quick setup) or an existing environment to run OpenSearch.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Some command line experience and a clients like curl or Postman to tests the requests.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>A dataset to index (you can try a simple JSON file or use the sample data provided in this article).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Note</strong>: For those who would prefer a cloud-based solution, you do not need to follow the local Docker instructions, and you can leverage a managed OpenSearch service available from any major cloud provider. The steps to create and manage indices remain similar.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<h2 id=\"3setupopensearch\">3. Set Up OpenSearch</h2>\n<p>Run OpenSearch locally using Docker. Copy and paste the following command in your terminal:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">docker run -d --name opensearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" opensearchproject/opensearch:2.9.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nHere’s what each part does:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>-d --name opensearch: Runs the container in the background with the name “opensearch.”\n-p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600: Exposes ports for HTTP requests and performance monitoring.\n-e \"discovery.type=single-node\": Tells OpenSearch to run as a single-node cluster for simplicity.\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nVerify the container is running by visiting <a href=\"http://localhost:9200\">http://localhost:9200</a>. You should see a JSON response with OpenSearch details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4createahybridindex\">4. Create a Hybrid Index</h2>\n<p>To enable AI-powered semantic search, you need to store vector embeddings along with traditional keyword fields in your documents. Let’s create an index called products. We’ll set it up with both text and vector fields to showcase a hybrid approach. <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/keyword-search/\">OpenSearch Documentation Reference</a></p>\n<p>\\\nCopy and paste this index mapping:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">curl -X PUT \"http://localhost:9200/products\" \n     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \n     -d '{ \n        \"settings\": { \n          \"index\": { \n            \"number_of_shards\": 1, \n            \"number_of_replicas\": 0 \n          } \n        }, \n        \"mappings\": { \n          \"properties\": { \n            \"name\": { \n              \"type\": \"text\" \n            }, \n            \"description\": { \n              \"type\": \"text\" \n            },\n            \"keywords\": { \n              \"type\": \"keyword\" \n            }, \n            \"embedding\": { \n              \"type\": \"dense_vector\", \n              \"dims\": 768 \n            } \n          } \n        } \n      }'\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"explanation\">Explanation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>name and description: Standard text fields for keyword-based search.</li>\n<li>keywords: A keyword field for filtering or exact matches (e.g., category tags).</li>\n<li>embedding: A dense vector field for storing AI-generated embeddings. Set dims to 768 to match common BERT transformer model or other language models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"5generateaiembeddingandindex\">5. Generate AI Embedding and Index</h2>\n<p>Next we will need to generate an embedding for each document, a numerical representation that reflects the meaning of the text. You can either use an open-source model like Hugging Face) or use a service like OpenAI Embeddings API. Below is an example using Hugging Face's sentence-transformers. <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/keyword-search/\">OpenSearch Documentation Reference</a></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport requests\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\n#1.

Sample documents to index\n\ndocuments = [ \n  { \"name\": \"Blue Backpack\", \n    \"description\": \"A spacious bag suitable for school and travel\", \n    \"keywords\": [\"bags\", \"backpack\", \"school\"],\n  }, \n  { \"name\": \"Leather Handbag\", \n    \"description\": \"Stylish handbag made from genuine leather\", \n    \"keywords\": [\"fashion\", \"handbag\", \"leather\"], \n  } \n]\n\n#3. Generate embeddings and index\n\nfor i, doc in enumerate(documents): \n  textToEmbed = doc[\"name\"] + \" \" + doc[\"description\"] \n  embedding = model.encode(textToEmbed).tolist()  # Convert to list for JSON serialization\n\n  payload = {\n    \"name\": doc[\"name\"],\n    \"description\": doc[\"description\"],\n    \"keywords\": doc[\"keywords\"],\n    \"embedding\": embedding\n  }\n\n  response = requests.post(\n    \"http://localhost:9200/products/_doc/\" + str(i),\n    json=payload\n  )\n\n  print(f\"Indexed document {i}. Status code: {response.status_code}, Response: {response.json()}\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"howtorunthescript\">How to run the script:</h3>\n<p>1.    Save above code in a file with name <code>index_documents.py</code></p>\n<p>2.    Run <code>pip install sentence-transformers requests</code> if you haven’t already</p>\n<p>3.    Execute <code>python index_documents.py</code></p>\n<p>\\\nThis script loads a small transformer model that produces 768-dimensional embeddings, iterates over couple of sample documents, combines text string from name and description, and encodes it into an embedding and then sends each document along with the embedding to OpenSearch via HTTP POST.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"6hybridquerycombiningkeywordvectorsearch\">6. Hybrid Query: Combining Keyword &amp; Vector Search</h2>\n<p>Pairing a standard keyword-based match and a vector based similarity query. OpenSearch provides various query types, below is an example using the <code>_search</code> endpoint. <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/keyword-search/\">OpenSearch Documentation Reference</a></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code class=\"json language-json\">curl -X POST \"http://localhost:9200/products/_search\" \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{\n  \"size\": 5,\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"should\": [\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"name\": \"bag\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"description\": \"bag\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"script_score\": {\n            \"query\": {\n              \"match_all\": {}\n            },\n            \"script\": {\n              \"source\": \"cosineSimilarity(params.queryVector, doc['\"embedding\"']) + 1.0\",\n              \"params\": {\n                \"queryVector\": replace this text with the user query embedding array\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}'\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"considerations\">Considerations:</h3>\n<p>•    script_score: Vector-based scoring using cosine similarity.

Participation in PoD requires holding a Mining Passport NFT.</li>\n<li>Decentralized Autonomous Storage (DACS): DACS serves as the foundation of Xenea’s decentralized storage system, enabling seamless integration between the blockchain and various file systems. SGM ensures the preservation of data over the long term. Initially integrating with IPFS, DACS is set to incorporate Xenea's own hash file system by 2025, supporting real-time editing of dynamic data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nThrough DACS, AI-generated data handled by any blockchain ecosystem in the AI era can be directly managed and stored on the Xenea blockchain. This enables the provision of highly reliable data storage infrastructure for various products.</p>\n<h3 id=\"backgroundofrecruitingecosystempartners\">Background of Recruiting Ecosystem Partners</h3>\n<p>Xenea features its own distributed storage system and operates as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, enabling businesses to handle a broader range of data on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the emerging era of the distributed web—integrated with advancements in AI, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI), and virtual technologies—secure and permanent data storage infrastructure is becoming increasingly essential.</p>\n<p>\\\nXenea aims to meet this need by offering its storage solutions to a broader range of Web3 projects. Xenea's public mainnet and Token Generation Event (TGE) are scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. As part of the preparation, a download campaign for the <strong><a href=\"https://xenea.io/wallet\">XENEA Wallet</a></strong> is underway as of December 2024.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis campaign serves as a critical step toward ensuring the robustness of the Proof of Democracy (PoD) security at the mainnet launch. Participants who contribute significantly during the campaign will be prioritized for token airdrops and Mining Passport NFTs. Wallets with these NFTs will play an active role in consensus and supporting the Xenea network structure.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe XENEA Wallet download campaign has achieved over 1.2 million downloads to date. This growing user base presents a significant opportunity for ecosystem partners, offering high visibility and user acquisition potential.</p>\n<p>\\\nBy leveraging the XENEA Wallet for exposure and engaging in collaborative cross-marketing initiatives, Xenea aims to foster mutual growth and strengthen the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a pilot cross-marketing initiative with <strong><a href=\"https://chat3.one/\">Chat3</a></strong>, an early adopter of the Xenea blockchain, over 250,000 users were successfully directed to their service, resulting in notable activity levels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/jEm0Gsq7mQUHLJ0ZGe4cAf9jPvU2-j0033xe.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Xenea is actively engaging in business development with local economic organizations and government bodies across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Future expansion into these regions is also being explored in collaboration with ecosystem partners.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo learn more about Xenea’s technology and development journey before applying as a partner, it is recommended to review their blog.

      "content": "Box office returns have started to stabilize. But nine of the top 10 box office hits this year were sequels [non-paywalled link]. And the 10th was \"Wicked.\" From a report: A year ago, Hollywood's creative community was celebrating the apparent decline of corporate, paint-by-numbers sequels and remakes. Blockbuster ticket sales for movies like \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Sound of Freedom\" and \"Barbie\" had shown -- or so it seemed -- that audiences were finally hungry for fresh stories. \n\nYou could almost hear the relief emanating from franchise-fatigued writers, directors and producers. \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" the wildly inventive Oscar-winning art film that broke out in cinemas in 2022, had not been a fluke! Alas. Mass moviegoing swung squarely back to the predictable this past year, with sequels filling nine of the top 10 slots at the North American box office. The ennead consisted of \"Inside Out 2,\" \"Despicable Me 4,\" \"Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,\" \"Moana 2,\" \"Dune: Part Two,\" \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,\" \"Kung Fu Panda 4,\" \"Twisters\" and the 38th Godzilla movie, \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\" \n\n\"Wicked,\" a song-by-song adaptation of the first half of the long-running Broadway musical, was the only top-10 outlier, counting as original, if only by a witchy whisker. (In the alternative reality of Hollywood, a movie can be \"original\" even if it is derivative of something else.

Poland Spring is now owned by Tampa, Florida-based Primo Brands, following multiple corporate transactions.\nConsumers sued Nestle Waters, then owned by Nestle, in 2017, saying it deceived them into overpaying for Poland Spring with labels declaring it to be \"Natural Spring Water\" or \"100% Natural Spring Water.\" \n\nThe plaintiffs said \"not one drop\" of the 1 billion gallons sold annually in the United States came from a natural spring, and that the actual Poland Spring in Maine \"ran dry\" two decades before Nestle bought the brand in 1992. In seeking a dismissal, Nestle Waters said geologists and officials in the eight states agreed that Poland Spring complied with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration rule defining spring water, and each state authorized its sale as \"spring water.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Judge+Will+Not+Dismiss+Lawsuit+Claiming+Poland+Spring+Water+is+Not+From+a+Spring%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F1326233%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F1326233%2Fjudge-will-not-dismiss-lawsuit-claiming-poland-spring-water-is-not-from-a-spring%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/1326233/judge-will-not-dismiss-lawsuit-claiming-poland-spring-water-is-not-from-a-spring?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568021&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

From a report: \"Given the conclusive evidence on the cancer risk from alcohol consumption and the Office of the Surgeon General's responsibility to inform the American public of the best available scientific evidence, the Surgeon General recommends an update to the Surgeon General's warning label for alcohol-containing beverages to include a cancer risk warning,\" Dr. Vivek Murthy said in the advisory Friday. \n\nThe advisory notes that alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the country, after tobacco and obesity. \"Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States -- greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the U.S. -- yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,\" Murthy said in a news release. The advisory also says more than 740,000 cancer cases globally could be attributed to alcohol use in 2020.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Surgeon+General+Calls+For+Cancer+Risk+Warning+on+Alcoholic+Beverages%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F1316230%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F1316230%2Fsurgeon-general-calls-for-cancer-risk-warning-on-alcoholic-beverages%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/1316230/surgeon-general-calls-for-cancer-risk-warning-on-alcoholic-beverages?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568017&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Data Curation Details</h2>\n<p>In this section we describe our data generation procedure for training and for rendering the object scans from OmniObject3D to generate one of our benchmark test sets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"c1synthetictrainingdatasetgeneration\">C.1. Synthetic Training Dataset Generation</h3>\n<p><strong>Image Rendering.</strong> For an arbitrary 3D mesh asset, our Blender-based rendering pipeline first loads it into a scene and normalizes it to fit inside a unit cube. Our scene consists of a large rectangular bowl with a flat bottom, a common scene setup that 3D artists use for rendering to allow for realistic shading, and 4 point light sources and one area light source. We randomly place cameras around the object with 30mm to 70mm focal length for a 35mm sensor size equivalent. We randomly vary the distance, elevation (from 5 to 65 degrees), the LookAt point of the camera and generate images of 600 × 600 resolution (see Fig. 11). This variation in object/camera geometry allows capturing the variability of projective geometry in real world scenarios, coming from different capture devices and camera poses. This is in contrast with prior work that uses fixed intrinsics, fixed distance, and LookAt pointed at the center of the object.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn addition to RGB images, we extract segmentation masks, depth maps, intrinsics, extrinsics and object pose. We center crop the objects, mask out the background, resize images to 224 × 224 and process the additional annotations to account for the crop, segmentation and resize.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-3i830at.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"c2generatingtheomniobject3dtestingset\">C.2. Generating the OmniObject3D Testing Set</h3>\n<p>The original videos released by the OmniObject3D dataset have noisy foreground masks and are mostly taken indoor on a tabletop. To improve the lighting variability and ensure accurate segmentations, we follow the rendering procedure described in the previous section to generate testing data. Different from our training set generation, we use HDRI environment maps to generate scene lighting, which results in high lighting quality and diversity (see Fig. 12).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-3e930go.png\" alt=\"Figure 7.

From a report: The jet maker outlined on Friday more than a dozen steps it has taken in recent months to tackle a manufacturing quality crisis that has forced Boeing to slow production and has put it under the microscope of federal regulators. Some of the steps have been previously reported. \n\nBoeing restarted production at its 737 factory in December after a machinists strike stopped work for several months. The company is still producing far fewer 737 MAXs per month than it was in the months before the Alaska Airlines accident. Among the new procedures are another layer of random quality checks where plane parts are commonly removed and then put back. In the case of the MAX involved in last January's incident, workers failed to replace bolts needed to hold a door-plug in place. The plug had been opened to repair faulty rivets.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Boeing+Adds+More+Surprise+Quality+Checks+in+Its+Factories%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F138208%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F138208%2Fboeing-adds-more-surprise-quality-checks-in-its-factories%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/138208/boeing-adds-more-surprise-quality-checks-in-its-factories?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23568005&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

U.S. District Judge Eumi Lee on Thursday signed off on an agreement between the two sides mandating Anthropic to maintain existing guardrails that prevent its Claude AI chatbot from providing lyrics to songs owned by the publishers or create new song lyrics based on the copyrighted material.\n \nIn a statement, Anthropic said Claude \"isn't designed to be used for copyright infringement, and we have numerous processes in place designed to prevent such infringement.\" It added, \"Our decision to enter into this stipulation is consistent with those priorities. We continue to look forward to showing that, consistent with existing copyright law, using potentially copyrighted material in the training of generative AI models is a quintessential fair use.\" [...] Under the agreement, Anthropic will apply already-implemented guardrails in the training of new AI systems. The deal also provides an avenue for music publishers to intervene if the guardrails aren't working as intended.\n \n\"Publishers may notify Anthropic in writing that its Guardrails are not effectively preventing output that reproduces, distributes, or displays, in whole or in part, the lyrics to compositions owned or controlled by Publishers, or creates derivative works based on those compositions,\" the filing states. \"Anthropic will respond to Publishers expeditiously and undertake an investigation into those allegations, with which Publishers will cooperate in good faith.\" Anthropic has maintained in court filings that existing guardrails make it unlikely that any future user could prompt Claude to produce any material portion of the works-in-suit. They consist of a \"range of technical and other measures -- at all levels in the development lifecycle -- that aim to prevent users from simply prompting Claude to regurgitate training data,\" said a company spokesperson. The court is expected to issue a ruling in the coming months on whether to issue preliminary injunction that would bar Anthropic from training future models on lyrics owned by the publishers.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Music+Publishers+Reach+Deal+With+AI+Giant+Anthropic+Over+Copyrighted+Song+Lyrics%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F0441238%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F0441238%2Fmusic-publishers-reach-deal-with-ai-giant-anthropic-over-copyrighted-song-lyrics%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/0441238/music-publishers-reach-deal-with-ai-giant-anthropic-over-copyrighted-song-lyrics?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567795&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "Xiaomi has further restricted bootloader unlocking to just one device per user per year, significantly hindering custom ROM development and reinforcing user dependence on its proprietary HyperOS ecosystem. Android Police reports: Roughly a year ago, Xiaomi introduced a policy limiting users to three unlocked devices per account, providing only a limited time window for unlocking, and demanding waiting periods before doing so. It's now gone even further, limiting users to unlocking the bootloader of just a single device throughout the year. Unlocking the bootloader changes the way a phone works by preventing automated software updates, among other things, and isn't a good idea for most users. Power users love it for complete customization of their devices, and unlocked bootloaders are critical to the creation and installation of privately developed operating systems, or custom ROMs.\n \nCustom ROMs usually (but not always) derive from pre-existing OSs like Android or Xiaomi's HyperOS. To write operating software that works on a certain device, you need to develop it on that specific device. Consequently, individuals and teams throughout the enthusiast phone sphere constantly add to their collections of bootloader-unlocked phones. The new unlocking restrictions could place undue hardship on resource-limited development teams, reducing the number of custom ROMs produced moving forward. Xiaomi first tightened restrictions roughly a year ago, following the enforcement of a Chinese law requiring certain pre-installed software behaviors. But Xiaomi's business plan and sales models indicate a couple of other motivations for insisting users stick with its first-party HyperOS. Some of the motives include preventing scalping, avoiding accidental bricking, and preserving advertising-driven revenue. However, these measures come at the cost of user freedom and may stifle innovation within the enthusiast developer community.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Drastically+Reduced+Xiaomi+Bootloader+Unlock+Policy+Raises+Questions+Over+Device+Ownership%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F0437208%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F0437208%2Fdrastically-reduced-xiaomi-bootloader-unlock-policy-raises-questions-over-device-ownership%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/0437208/drastically-reduced-xiaomi-bootloader-unlock-policy-raises-questions-over-device-ownership?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567791&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

They are luminescent nanocrystals that can change intensity and/or color when you push or pull on them. These \"all-optical\" nanosensors are probed with light only and therefore allow for fully remote read-outs -- no wires or connections are needed. They have 100 times better force sensitivity than the existing nanoparticles that utilize rare-earth ions for their optical response, and an operational range that spans more than four orders of magnitude in force, a much larger range -- 10-100 times larger -- than any previous optical nanosensor. \"We expect our discovery will revolutionize the sensitivities and dynamic range achievable with optical force sensors, and will immediately disrupt technologies in areas from robotics to cellular biophysics and medicine to space travel,\" said Jim Schuck, associate professor of mechanical engineering.\n \n\"The importance of developing new force sensors was recently underscored by Ardem Patapoutian, the 2021 Nobel Laureate who emphasized the difficulty in probing environmentally sensitive processes within multiscale systems -- that is to say, in most physical and biological processes,\" Schuck notes. \"We are excited to be part of these discoveries that transform the paradigm of sensing, allowing one to sensitively and dynamically map critical changes in forces and pressures in real-world environments that are currently unreachable with today's technologies.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=New+'All-Optical'+Nanoscale+Sensors+of+Force+Access+Previously+Unreachable+Environments%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F0429229%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F0429229%2Fnew-all-optical-nanoscale-sensors-of-force-access-previously-unreachable-environments%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/0429229/new-all-optical-nanoscale-sensors-of-force-access-previously-unreachable-environments?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567779&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Constellation, the country's largest operator of nuclear power plants, will deliver electricity to more than 13 federal agencies as part of the agreements with the U.S. General Services Administration. The deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which constructs and manages federal buildings, and is among the first major climate-focused energy agreement by the U.S. government to include electricity generated from existing nuclear reactors.\n \nThe GSA estimated that the contracts, set to begin on April 25, will comprise over 10 million megawatt-hours over 10 years and provide electricity equivalent to powering more than 1 million homes annually. The procurement will deliver electricity to 80 federal facilities located throughout the PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission operator with service covering more than 65 million people. The U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Army Corps of Engineers are some of the facilities that will receive the power. [...] Constellation said the deal will enable it to extend the licenses of existing nuclear plants and invest in new equipment and technology that will increase output by about 135 megawatts. \"The investments we make as a result of this contract will keep these plants operating reliably for decades to come and put new, clean nuclear energy on the grid while making the best use of taxpayer dollars,\" Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez said in a release.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Constellation+Inks+%241+Billion+Deal+To+Supply+US+Government+With+Nuclear+Power%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F012202%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F012202%2Fconstellation-inks-1-billion-deal-to-supply-us-government-with-nuclear-power%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/012202/constellation-inks-1-billion-deal-to-supply-us-government-with-nuclear-power?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567649&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

The Register reports: Figures for December 2024 from Statcounter -- used because Microsoft rarely shares usage data unless it has something to boast about -- confirm Windows 10's market share has inched up to 62.7 percent compared to the previous month while Windows 11's share fell back to 34.12 percent (from 34.94 percent in November 2024). Even though Windows 11's percentage of the pie is still bigger than it was this time last year (when Statcounter pegged it at 26.54 percent), the fact the new OS is still nowhere near to overtaking Windows 10 may alarm some Microsoft executives. [...]\n \nCanalys analyst, Kieren Jessop, noted that when looking at the more than 230 countries and regions tracked by Statcounter, Windows 10 share had actually only increased in just under a quarter of them, but that increase made an outsized impacted. Jessop cited the example of the US, where Windows 10 market share had gone from 58 percent in October 2024 to 67 percent in December. [...] Many editions of Windows 10 are due to drop out of free support on October 14, 2025. Affected users will then have the option to purchase Extended Security Updates (ESU) to keep the lights on a little longer or keep using the operating system and risk falling foul of unpatched vulnerabilities.

      "content": "Samsung is set to debut its new Odyssey 3D monitor at CES 2025, reviving the glasses-free 3D experience that manufacturers pushed on consumers over a decade ago. While details remain limited, the monitor reportedly utilizes a lenticular lens, stereo cameras, and AI to convert 2D content into lifelike 3D visuals, with a focus on appealing to gamers for broader adoption. Ars Technica reports: According to the South Korean company's announcement, the monitor's use of a lenticular lens that is \"attached to the front of the panel and its front stereo camera\" means that you don't have to wear glasses to access the monitor's \"customizable 3D experience.\" Lenticular lenses direct different images to each eye to make images look three-dimensional. This is a notable advancement from the first 3D monitor that Samsung released in 2009. That display used Nvidia software and Nvidia shutter glasses to allow users to toggle between a 2D view and a 3D view through a few button presses and supported content.\n \nAnother advancement is the Odyssey 3D's claimed ability to use artificial intelligence \"to analyze and convert 2D video into 3D.\" We've recently seen similar technology from brands like Acer, which announced portable monitors in 2022 and then announced laptops that could convert 2D content into stereoscopic 3D in 2023. Those displays also relied on AI, as well as a specialized optical lens and a pair of eye-tracking cameras, to create the effect. But unlike Acer's portable monitors, Samsung claims that its monitor can make 2D content look like 3D even if that content doesn't officially support 3D. [...] Interestingly, Samsung's announcement today only mentioned the release of a 27-inch, 4K resolution 3D monitor, despite Samsung teasing a 37-inch version in August. It's possible that the larger version didn't work as well and/or that demand for the larger size would be too small, considering the high price and limited demand implications of a glasses-free 3D monitor aimed at gamers.

      "content": "<h2 id=\"1introduction\">1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>For the past years, we’ve seen an increasing interest in using safe applications and making them as reactive as possible. For this, there are many technologies developed throughout the years, and today the most popular ones seem to be Spring <code>WebFlux</code> and <code>Kotlin Coroutines</code>. As I’ll show in this article, both technologies complement each other and can live in the same JVM ecosystem. As you probably have noticed already, there are many times discussions over which one of them offers the best performance, but essentially they both assume the same principle, which is to avoid anything that is blocking as much as possible. <code>WebFlux</code> takes advantage of the Observer Pattern using <code>Flux</code> and <code>Mono</code> to deliver collections and single objects and <code>Coroutines</code> use <code>Flow</code> and suspend functions to deliver exactly the same respectively.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this article, we will look at one of the many ways to keep an application's behavior closely under watch and use Prometheus as a data scrapper, InfluxDB as a persistence mechanism, and Grafana to visualize our data. The project for this article is located on <a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">GitHub</a>. When an application gets developed, the assumption that we can move straight to production because the unit tests (TDD — Test Driven Development) and the integration tests did not detect any problem can still be very risky. </p>\n<p>\\\nEven when an experienced tester has made his best effort to pen test the application and has made all the necessary business logic checkups, we are still relying on a human factor and we still haven’t considered system or network issues. BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) many times comes into the equation as a means to prevent errors in production. There is always an extra element of reliability given that BDD checks the behavior of a running environment. A typically known framework used to achieve this is Cucumber.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a case scenario, and only considering numbers, which gives the business a sense of how safe are we to go to production, is that we have about 90% code coverage, we have given coverage to the logic that the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) did not detect, the BDD tests are fine, and we have a superb and ultra professional DDD (Domain Driven Design) expert which assures us that all of the architecture and boundaries match all the expectations of the PO (Product Owner). We are also very proud to have a team where everyone knows all software design patterns by heart and uses them and thinks about them in their daily developments. Furthermore, everyone knows how to implement and use SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov-substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Injection) and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles.Everything seems fine, we go to production, and then we realize that the application isn’t really doing what it was supposed to do. Furthermore, it seems to display all sorts of unexpected behavior. In these scenarios, the problem may well be that we did not have any concerns about the CPU, GPU, memory usage, GC (Garbage Collection), Security and the list goes on. We didn’t check the downtime of the application, we didn’t check the resilience of the application, availability, and robustness. We also didn’t figure out what to do in case of concurrency, multiple users and how much data actually needs to flow in and out of our application. Monitoring can offer a lot of help to prevent these situations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2technicalrequirements\">2. Technical Requirements</h2>\n<p>For this article, it is helpful if you have some experience and understanding of Spring and Spring Boot, albeit not essential. We will check out the complete details of the implementation, so if you don’t know some basics, then don’t worry, because I will try my best to keep it easy. What’s really important is to have the following installed on your machine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Java 17 (any java 17 distribution will do. My best advice is to use SDK Man) to achieve this and use 17-open.</li>\n<li>Latest gradle (At least version 7.5 in order to be compatible with Java 17)</li>\n<li>A good IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse for example)</li>\n<li>Docker Desktop , but only if you are using an office-oriented machine, with a system like MAC-OS or Windows. My best advice is to just use a Linux machine with 12 cores if possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3articlegoals\">3. Article Goals</h2>\n<p>When talking about monitoring, we mostly make a few assumptions. It’s easy, it doesn’t take too much time to set up, and we just want to check if the system is ok. Further, there is this generalized assumption that we shouldn’t complicate it too much. Indeed, these are all valid points, up to a point. On the other hand, if we think about what actually needs to be done to make monitoring a reality in our environment, then we quickly begin to realize that there are quite a few moving parts to make monitoring a reality. Let’s think about what we need on a very high level:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We want metrics</li>\n<li>We want to have those metrics in our system</li>\n<li>We need to fetch metrics</li>\n<li>We need to store metrics</li>\n<li>We need to visualize these metrics</li>\n<li>We need an alert system</li>\n<li>Our system should not be impaired in any way in terms of performance</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nLooking at point 1, mostly, we are sure that we need metrics. Now we need to do the hard work of thinking about “which metrics do we need”? Do we need to monitor the <code>Garbage Collection</code>? Do we need to monitor resources? Do we need to monitor memory usage? Maybe we need all of these metrics, or maybe we already know firsthand what we want to monitor. It’s good to have an idea beforehand of what we want. For points 2 and 3, we need to make sure that we have considered using a push or a pull mechanism. In this article, we are going to look at the pull mechanism. We will see this in both <code>Prometheus</code> and <code>InfluxDB</code>. The biggest advantage of a pull mechanism is that, once our application is running, we can control at any time what we want to receive, by scrapping the data at specific and configurable points in time. A push mechanism implies that the application is constantly sending metrics through the wire even when we want to scale down our metrics fetching mechanism. In other orders, monitoring will always make a small dent in the application performance, but we can scale that down if we use a pull mechanism. What’s important is to make that decrease in performance completely negligible. Next, in point 4 we need to store our data. Fetching mechanisms come many times with ephemeral storage engines. These engines are so called because they can be reset by restart, they are only kept in memory, they have a rolling log or simply they are not well-designed to have persisted data. This is what happens with Prometheus. Although it does have provisions to persist data, it is still very basic and with some limitations in their <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/\">own words</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you run the rule backfiller multiple times with the overlapping start/end times, blocks containing the same data will be created each time the rule backfiller is run.All rules in the recording rule files will be evaluated.If the interval is set in the recording rule file that will take priority over the eval-interval flag in the rule backfill command.Alerts are currently ignored if they are in the recording rule file.Rules in the same group cannot see the results of previous rules. Meaning that rules that refer to other rules being backfilled is not supported. A workaround is to backfill multiple times and create the dependent data first (and move dependent data to the Prometheus server data dir so that it is accessible from the Prometheus API).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>in <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/\">https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/</a></p>\n<p>\\\nFor these reasons, we need another element in our system that will make sure that the longevity of our data is determined by us and not the system. We will achieve this in our example with InfluxDB. Once our data is stored we now need a clean and easy way to visualize data. That is point 5. In many systems, the visualization software also allows us to configure our requirements for point 6. Alert systems usually go hand in hand with the visualization interface we are using. This is where we will see Grafana in action. In terms of point 7, that can be a fallacy in itself. There is always a very small decrease in performance, which should always be negligible as we discussed above. We can also say that if that decrease isn’t perceptible then it’s because it does not exist. It is a fair point, and it makes complete sense, but it’s important to think about it. Misconfigured monitoring solutions can cause latency issues and make the application unresponsive or even bring a system to a shutdown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4domain\">4. Domain</h2>\n<p>Our service is a simulation of a real system. Ideally, we would surveil objects in a museum for example. We could monitor the location of boats passing by a river, check the weather in airports, the affluence of people at a concert, etc. If we have a camera, we can imagine thousands of cases of what we can do with them. In this project, we will make this very simple. We will surveil vegetables on a wooden floor! This way nothing else will matter but the goal of our project:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxxmab3swpcsd2y4yan5j.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>One service will provide two resource <code>endpoints</code>. One <code>endpoint</code> will give you the image captured at a given time to a certain camera. The other <code>endpoint</code> provides information about the object we are filming. For our application, we are not interested in having this information separate. Instead, we want to access this information in an aggregated way. We also do not want the front end to do all the hard aggregation work. That processing should be left to a new service that will wrap up this “raw data” service and provide the desired aggregated information. Once we have this service available, then we want to be able to visualize our data with a <code>front-end</code> application. So now, we know that we need at least three services. One for raw data, one for the aggregation data, and another to provide a GUI (graphic user interface) to the user. Consequentially, we also need to be able to monitor these services. This means that we’ll need at least three different metrics providers working as a sidecar along these three services. With our 3 services to 3 metric providers, we need a scrapper to be able to visualize this data. Once we have the scrapper, we also want to be able to visualize this data and we also want to be able to store this data. So this means that we’ll need another 3 services. One scrapper, one visualizer, and a persistence service. Here is a rough sketch of how this works:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpit253uqm8sh9sko715c.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Moving Objects project</p>\n<h2 id=\"5implementation\">5. Implementation</h2>\n<p>Let’s start to make our application! The case we are going to look at is a system that will surveil the movement of objects.In a previous version of this article, the cameras were provided by two rest interfaces of RapidAPI. One provided an airport list and another the public cameras around the airport. These were the Airport Finder API and the Webcams Travel API. However, because these apps are external, I could not have any control over them. I also wouldn’t be able to control any changes in the model or if the application would for one reason or the other become private, on subscription, trial, or any other form of non-public access. At some point in time, the original example of this article became effectively non-functional, non-compilable, and of course not possible to make a demo of. This means that now, instead of surveilling locations around airports, we now have an example of surveilling moving objects on a grid of locations. I simply took a few photos of these vegetables to create an idea of movement.In order to make things a bit more interesting, I’ve created 2 rest applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>moving-objects-jwt-service</strong> — A secured application, JWT capable, providing two separate endpoints. One delivers the object/vegetable information and the other the camera location in a 2-dimensional grid. This application is opened at port 8081. This application has been implemented with Spring Boot and Kotlin Webflow Coroutines. It uses an r2dbc connection against a PostgreSQL database on port 5432.</li>\n<li><strong>moving-objects-rest-service</strong> — This one will serve the front-end application and is facing the user. We can optionally start it with OAuth2 <code>Okta</code> Authentication capability. It will authenticate, in order to communicate with the JWT service. It runs on port 8082. This application has been implemented with Spring Boot and <code>WebFlux</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nI have also created a <code>GUI</code> (<code>Graphic User Interface</code>). In this case, I am using Angular, and for the <code>UX</code> (<code>User eXperience</code>) design implementation, I am using <code>Angular Materials</code>.The reason for the creation of the 2 rest services is because I find it to be one great way of showing monitoring in action. We make one service depend on the other, where the goal of the edge service is to aggregate both sources of information. Therefore, we can analyze more different data behavior cases. I have also implemented OAUTH2 for the same reasons. In other words, I wanted one service to have different behavior than the other. We will see a glimpse of that at the end of this article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6applicationsetup\">6. Application Setup</h2>\n<p>\\\nIn this section, we’ll have a look at the application overview, how everything is set up, and the containerized environment.Let’s start with the application overview:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzsda02g7y2dyam3x33df.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Application Overview</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this simplified overview, we can see that, before we get any data, we are going through 3 services. We have an angular service running on <code>NGINX</code>, to provide the front-end, one rest server with okta authentication to provide access to an aggregation of data, and finally, a service that provides the raw data using <code>JWT</code> to access it securely. Let’s have a closer look at what the containerized environment looks like. In our previous requirement enumeration, we saw that we need at least 4 things. We need three application environments, a data resource, a permanent persistence mechanism, and a visualization environment for the monitored data. In our case, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>JRE 17</strong> — We’ll use this runtime in two services. As we have seen before, one runs in the Data Source domain and the other in the aggregator domain. In each of the environments, we’ll be running not only the applications but also the metrics service as a side car to the spring-boot applications. Spring boot can pack external libraries like the ones provided by Prometheus and use them in its actuator endpoints.</li>\n<li><strong>NGINX</strong> — With NGINX, we can deploy our front end as a static deliverable. It runs in the UX domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Node</strong> — Node JS enables us to run a Prometheus service to provide metrics to the Prometheus scrapper. It runs in the Metrics domain. The runtime does not have to share the same domain as the machine it's running in. With Node, we can start a service, not necessarily to get metrics about NGINX, but the machine where it runs.</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus</strong> — This is the scrapper. A scrapper in this case is just a process that runs in fixed timed intervals a scrapping process to retrieve important metrics from target machines. It runs in the Metrics Domain.</li>\n<li><strong>InfluxDB</strong> — This is our persistence mechanism. InfluxDB also has the power to configure scrappers. They run the same way as Prometheus, but we can store the data. It includes its own metric visualization application.

No extra configuration is needed when using Docker. It’s important to notice from the image that the only ports that are supposed to be part of the public domain are <code>3000</code>, <code>9090</code>, and <code>8080</code>. In a local environment, we will expose all ports. Further down this document, we will see how the security version of this project works. For that one, we will also need port <code>8082</code>. All other ports are inside the docker domain. Every container is aware of each other by the names we have given to them. We’ll see how to translate this system to docker-compose further on in the article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7datamodel\">7. Data model</h2>\n<p>Our data model is exceptionally simple. We only have two <code>tables</code>. One with the <code>Object</code> <code>Info</code> and the other one with the <code>Moving Object</code> info:</p>\n<pre><code>create schema if not exists mos;\ndrop table if exists mos.moving_object;\ndrop table if exists mos.info_object;\ncreate table if not exists mos.moving_object(\n    id UUID,\n    code VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL,\n    folder VARCHAR ( 255 ) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    uri VARCHAR(255 ) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    x INT,\n    y INT,\n    PRIMARY KEY (id)\n);\ncreate table if not exists mos.info_object(\n    id UUID,\n    \"name\" VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    \"size\" INT,\n    color VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL,\n    code VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL,\n    x INT,\n    y INT,\n    PRIMARY KEY (id)\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>\n<p>\\\nBoth tables share a <code>code</code>. This <code>code</code> is what unifies the data together. However, this data t isn’t given together to the front end. Instead, we provide this data separately. The table moving<em>object , can be interpreted as the location, where an object with a certain <code>code</code> is being filmed. The uriis the location of the camera that provides the latest snapshot being taken. The parameter folder is the actual location where the image is being saved. This latest snapshot will be delivered to the client using a streaming endpoint. Evidently, x and y are the coordinates of the object. The table info</em>object simply contains extra information about the object being filmed. An object, for this project, has special information regarding its name, size, color, and location. The location is here also expressed in coordinates <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. The reason for this is to distinguish the location of the camera and the location of the object. Having said that we can also argue the coordinates of the object we are filming don’t really matter that much. The start of the project will load the following data in the database:</p>\n<pre><code>truncate mos.mos.moving_object;\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'GAR', 'garlic', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/GAR',1,2);\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'LAU', 'laurel', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/LAU',2,2);\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'LEM', 'lemon', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/LEM',3,4);\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'ONI', 'onion', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/ONI',7,2);\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'PUM', 'pumpkin', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/PUM',8,1);\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'RED', 'red-onion', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/RED',3,6);\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'SNA', 'snail', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/SNA',1,7);\ninsert into mos.mos.moving_object (id,  code, folder, uri,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'TOM', 'tomato', '/aggregator/webcams/camera/TOM',0,1);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Garlic', 2, 'white', 'GAR', 1, 2);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Laurel', 4, 'green', 'LAU', 2, 2);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Lemon', 2, 'lemon', 'LEM', 3, 4);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Onion', 4, 'gold', 'ONI', 7, 2);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Pumpkin', 10, 'orange', 'PUM', 8, 1);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Red Onion', 5, 'purple', 'RED', 3, 6);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Snail', 1, 'brown', 'SNA', 1, 7);\ninsert into mos.mos.info_object(id, \"name\", size, color, code,x,y)\nvalues (gen_random_uuid(), 'Tomato', 2, 'red','TOM', 0, 1);\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"8code\">8. Code</h2>\n<p>If you already have had a sneak peek at the code on <a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">GitHub</a>, you’ve probably already seen that the code base is quite small per module, but the conjunction of all the code may be a bit complicated to understand. This section is here so that we can see together how the code is built and what we want to achieve. Maybe the best thing to do, to start off is to have a look at the data domain in the <code>moving-objects-jwt-service</code>:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3zqqixx1zptfg3r675um.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Dao UML for moving-objects-jwt-service</p>\n<p>\\\nThere isn’t really too much special in this <code>UML</code> chart. Essentially we just have two different types and we call them MovingObject and <code>InfoObject</code>. <code>Cameras</code> have got a location in an <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> grid in the same way that <code>Objects</code> do. We consider the <code>MovingObject</code> to be what the Camera is filming. We can and will use these terms interchangeably to refer to the same thing. <code>InfoObject</code> is just some information about the object. In this case, it’s just the size, the color of the object, and its latest location. The latest location never changes in this project. Although the <code>JWT</code> service is mostly implemented using Coroutine data <code>Flows</code>, I wanted to use <code>WebFlux</code> in the same project to show that both can work together in the same way. Although their reactive implementations are different, they can work together, and we can make use of the different features they both can offer. In my case, I really wanted to make use of the <code>collectSortedList</code> function to create a reactive <code>Mono</code> from a list of objects of the type <code>MovingObject</code>. Many people prefer to use the <code>JpaSpecificationExecutor</code> to get a full <code>page</code> in one go. Unfortunately, if we do that, then we get a non-reactive Page in return. It probably doesn’t matter much in the end because effectively a <code>Page</code> is by all means just one record given back to the client. However, I wanted this application service to be completely reactive regardless. And so instead of returning a <code>Page</code>, I get to return a <code>Mono&lt;Page&gt;</code> which keeps the usage of the application possibly to be completely reactive. So now that we’ve looked at the <code>Model</code>, let’s now have look at the controller part:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fny82i42smakoymx1wymo.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>REST UML for moving-objects-jwt-service</p>\n<p>We convert the data into the <code>DTOs</code> in very specific ways but never join the object info with the <code>cameras</code>. In our case, we’ll associate a location with all cameras contained in a specific radius of it. This will give us the full list of all the cameras for a specific search, but not the object's info in relation to their sizes and color. This is for one endpoint. For the other endpoint, we can get the object's info. With this one, we’ll know the object's location, color, and size. What this rest service does not offer is an aggregation of the <code>cameras</code> and object info.</p>\n<p>This service also needs to be accessed via security. For this project, we make it very simple and when we run it, we’ll get a warning that we are using one user/password combination configured in the clear in application.properties. Normally, security services have a much more complicated way of providing security. Let’s have a quick look at the code:</p>\n<pre><code>@Bean\nfun securityFilterChain(http: ServerHttpSecurity): SecurityWebFilterChain =\n    http\n        .logout { logout -&gt;\n            logout\n                .requiresLogout(ServerWebExchangeMatchers.pathMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, \"/logoff\"))\n        }\n        .authorizeExchange { authorize -&gt;\n            authorize\n                .pathMatchers(\"/webjars/**\")\n                .permitAll()\n                .pathMatchers(\"/info/jwt/open/**\")\n                .permitAll()\n                .pathMatchers(\"/webcams/jwt/open/**\")\n                .permitAll()\n                .pathMatchers(\"/v3/**\")\n                .permitAll()\n                .pathMatchers(\"/actuator/**\")\n                .permitAll()\n                .anyExchange()\n                .authenticated()\n        }\n        .csrf().disable()\n        .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())\n        .oauth2ResourceServer { oAuth2ResourceServerSpec -&gt; oAuth2ResourceServerSpec.jwt() }\n        .build()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nWhat we are doing here is first allowing all matching patterns to be open publicly. These patterns refer to 3 important aspects of the application: Swagger, Actuator, and test endpoints. Swagger allows us to interact with the application via a GUI that allows us to perform requests without needing to use curl or any other command line instructions like wget. The Actuator endpoint is vital for our project because it provides metrics including the ones Prometheus understands and uses. <code>CSRF</code> must be disabled in our application. The <code>Spring</code> documentation is very clear about why is this true for most cases:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you are only creating a service that is used by non-browser clients, you will likely want to disable <code>CSRF</code> protection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>in <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.x/reference/html/csrf.html\">https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.x/reference/html/csrf.html</a></p>\n<p>\\\nThe authentication for our token will be asked via a specific endpoint that we’ll see later on. For now, I just want you to get the idea that with our configuration, we can access any of our endpoints either with a username/password combination or with a <code>JWT</code> token. The <code>JWT</code> token, however, will only be given via the token endpoint. We protect our application though, with the OAuthResourceServerSpec. This allows us to configure several types of security settings, but for the purpose of this article, we just create the standard <code>JWT</code> support. Reactive programming also implies reactive security because security is something inherently bound to any request we make to our services. The principle though is exactly the same as in non-reactive applications. We first configure our AuthenticationManager:</p>\n<pre><code>@Bean\nfun authenticationManager(): ReactiveAuthenticationManager {\n    return UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager(userDetailsService())\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nWe then need to configure encoders and decoders for the <code>JWT</code> token itself and also for the password we are using to get the initial <code>JWT</code> request for the application:</p>\n<pre><code>@Bean\nfun jwtDecoder(): ReactiveJwtDecoder = NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder.withPublicKey(rsaPublicKey).build()\n\n@Bean\nfun jwtEncoder(): JwtEncoder =\n    NimbusJwtEncoder(ImmutableJWKSet(JWKSet(RSAKey.Builder(rsaPublicKey).privateKey(rsaPrivateKey).build())))\n\n@Bean\nfun passwordEncoder(): PasswordEncoder {\n    return BCryptPasswordEncoder()\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nCodecs for the <code>JWT</code> rest service</p>\n<p>Once we have the codes, we can now configure our <code>UserDetailsService</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>@Bean\n@SuppressWarnings(\"deprecated\")\nfun userDetailsService(): MapReactiveUserDetailsService? {\n    val user = withDefaultPasswordEncoder()\n        .username(username)\n        .password(password)\n        .roles(*roles)\n        .build()\n    return MapReactiveUserDetailsService(user)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nUserDetailsService</p>\n<p>\\\nWe can already see that this UserDetailsService is something different from its Servlet counterpart (we also all this in street language <code>MVC</code>). The difference is that this service is implemented in a reactive way. We are using Netty here and not Tomcat as a <code>SpringBoot</code> <code>embedded</code> Service. This means that Netty, works in a reactive way, which means that we can implement our calls to the service in a reactive way. This in turn improves the capacity of our machine, given that it will be able to hold more requests at the same time, even when security is involved. In our case, our service is safeguarded with username/password admin/admin. It is always good to be reminded that at this point security can be much better implemented. Our very unsafe admin/admin combination suffices though for the purpose of this exercise. Let’s now have a look at our service that will face the front-end. In the fully functional version of this service, we’ll use <code>Okta</code> to perform OAuth authentication. For the end-to-end tests, <code>Okta</code> will be disabled, but we will go through the whole application. Our application is called <code>moving-objects-rest-service</code> . The first contact with the previous application starts obviously at the data layer level:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3temaakw7vkrby2963t1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>DAO Layer of the <code>Okta</code> project</p>\n<p>Looking closely at these types, we can see how directly they relate to the <code>Dto’s</code> created in the <code>JWT</code> project.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ff1ztmmsjgdxi8owbydt4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Service Layer of the <code>Okta</code> Project</p>\n<p>In the service layer above, we see that we have dedicated services for each endpoint and next to it, we use an ObjectAggregatorService. This service will create the payload that we are interested in. The aggregation follows a few interesting implementations related to reactive programming. Let’s have a look at a few methods:</p>\n<pre><code>public Flux&lt;MovingObjectDto&gt; getObjectsAndCamsBySearchTermAndRadius(String term, Long radius) {\n    return objectsService.getObjectsByTerm(term)\n            .flatMap(objectDto -&gt; {\n                CoordinatesDto coordinates = objectDto.coordinates();\n                return webCamService.getCamsByLocationAndRadius(coordinates.x(), coordinates.y(), radius)\n                        .collectList().map(webCamDto -&gt; Pair.of(objectDto, webCamDto));\n            })\n            .map(webCamDtoPackage -&gt; {\n                final MovingObjectDto movingObjectDto = webCamDtoPackage.getFirst();\n                webCamDtoPackage.getSecond().forEach(webCam -&gt; movingObjectDto.webCams().add(webCam));\n                return movingObjectDto;\n            }).distinct();\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nCreating the MovingObjectDto</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this case, we are using purely <code>Spring</code> <code>WebFlux</code>. We first search for the object information by a search term. In the second step, we search for locations related to it by radius. So, in other words, we are going to retrieve all cameras contained within a specific radius pertaining to an object we have searched by a search word. We must never forget that when using <code>Coroutine Flows</code> or <code>WebFlux</code>, we are not doing imperative programming, and we are not doing <code>OOP</code> (<code>Object Oriented Programming</code>). We are using <code>Functional Programming</code>, implementing the <code>Observable Pattern</code>, and using <code>Reactive Principles</code>. What this means is that the code will not execute immediately instead, it will be executed when Netty is free to do so. It is probably good at this point to remind ourselves that by only using the Spring <code>WebFlux</code> libraries in our dependencies, we are no longer using Tomcat by default. We are using Netty at this point. The reason I want to make a statement here is that we see very often people using Tomcat in an interchangeable manner with <code>Spring Boot</code>. However, SpringBoot isn’t necessarily run by Tomcat. It can be run with Undertow and Jetty, and in the case of reactive services, it can then be run with Netty. It is important to make this distinction in advanced types of service implementation. We can now have a quick look at what the Controller layer looks like:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frj1lm9ty63xbo3jh4lgr.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><code>Controller</code> Layer of the <code>Okta</code> Service</p>\n<p>This layer is what allows us to work with our payload which has the following form:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fv66ss35xomxinjdtbdng.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Payload example to serve the front-end application</p>\n<p>\\\nAs we can see, we are providing details about our object, but also the details about the camera. We have thus, aggregated two endpoints into one in a reactive way that will be managed by Netty. Finally, we can have a look at how the optional <code>security</code> is implemented with <code>okta</code>. The only thing we need to do is to first add the <code>okta</code> libraries and a few extra helpful libraries:</p>\n<pre><code>implementation(\"com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:3.0.7\")\nimplementation(\"com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin:2.18.2\")\nimplementation(\"me.paulschwarz:spring-dotenv:4.0.0\")\nimplementation(\"org.springframework.security:spring-security-web:6.4.2\")\nimplementation(\"org.jesperancinha.objects:moving-objects-security-dsl:1.0.0\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>Dependencies used to provide security</p>\n<p>The actual relevant dependency is of course the <code>okta-spring-boot-starter</code> library. The others are important because they provide support. They are not per se necessary. They are, however necessary for the current version of the project and its library versions. The last library, moving-objects-security-dsl, is a very small library I made in order to only allow <code>Okta</code> security configurations to occur when the library is present. Trying to disable okta via spring profiles, was revealed to be an odd thing to do, and it just wasn’t helpful for this project to make something like that. So the library just contains one single class:</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\nclass SecurityConfiguration(\n    @Value(\"\\${objects.jwt.public.key}\")\n    var rsaPublicKey: RSAPublicKey,\n\n    @Value(\"\\${objects.jwt.private.key}\")\n    var rsaPrivateKey: RSAPrivateKey,\n\n    @Value(\"\\${objects.jwt.username}\")\n    var username: String,\n\n    @Value(\"\\${objects.jwt.password}\")\n    var password: String,\n\n    @Value(\"\\${objects.jwt.roles}\")\n    var roles: Array&lt;String&gt;,\n) {\n\n    @Bean\n    fun securityFilterChain(http: ServerHttpSecurity): SecurityWebFilterChain =\n        http\n            .logout { logout -&gt;\n                logout\n                    .requiresLogout(ServerWebExchangeMatchers.pathMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, \"/logoff\"))\n            }\n            .authorizeExchange { authorize -&gt;\n                authorize\n                    .pathMatchers(\"/webjars/**\")\n                    .permitAll()\n                    .pathMatchers(\"/info/jwt/open/**\")\n                    .permitAll()\n                    .pathMatchers(\"/webcams/jwt/open/**\")\n                    .permitAll()\n                    .pathMatchers(\"/v3/**\")\n                    .permitAll()\n                    .pathMatchers(\"/actuator/**\")\n                    .permitAll()\n                    .anyExchange()\n                    .authenticated()\n            }\n            .csrf().disable()\n            .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())\n            .oauth2ResourceServer { oAuth2ResourceServerSpec -&gt; oAuth2ResourceServerSpec.jwt() }\n            .build()\n\n    @Bean\n    fun authenticationManager(): ReactiveAuthenticationManager {\n        return UserDetailsRepositoryReactiveAuthenticationManager(userDetailsService())\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    fun jwtDecoder(): ReactiveJwtDecoder = NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder.withPublicKey(rsaPublicKey).build()\n\n    @Bean\n    fun jwtEncoder(): JwtEncoder =\n        NimbusJwtEncoder(ImmutableJWKSet(JWKSet(RSAKey.Builder(rsaPublicKey).privateKey(rsaPrivateKey).build())))\n\n    @Bean\n    fun passwordEncoder(): PasswordEncoder {\n        return BCryptPasswordEncoder()\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    @SuppressWarnings(\"deprecated\")\n    fun userDetailsService(): MapReactiveUserDetailsService? {\n        val user = withDefaultPasswordEncoder()\n            .username(username)\n            .password(password)\n            .roles(*roles)\n            .build()\n        return MapReactiveUserDetailsService(user)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Secure configuration</p>\n<p>What could have also been made is one Bean with profile prod and another bean with profile test and then just make the test bean a completely open website, with something like pathMatchers(“/**”).permitAll(). However, doing so, would still imply okta initialization anyway, and a level of unpredictability that I found to be unreasonable for the purposes of this project, and since Gradle is amazing in configuring assemblies the way we want I created thus a parameter configurable build using:</p>\n<pre><code>if (project.hasProperty(\"prod\")) {\n    implementation(\"com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:3.0.7\")\n    implementation(\"com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin:2.18.2\")\n    implementation(\"me.paulschwarz:spring-dotenv:4.0.0\")\n    implementation(\"org.springframework.security:spring-security-web:6.4.2\")\n    implementation(\"org.jesperancinha.objects:moving-objects-security-dsl:1.0.0\")\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Configurable build with Gradle</p>\n<p>The configuration in SpringBoot is as simple as this:</p>\n<pre><code># Okta\nokta.oauth2.issuer=${ISSUER}\nokta.oauth2.client-id=${CLIENT_ID}\nokta.oauth2.client-secret=${CLIENT_SECRET}\n#okta.oauth2.redirect-uri=http://localhost:8082/aggregator/login/oauth2/code/okta\nokta.oauth2.post-logout-redirect-uri=http://localhost:8082/aggregator/signout\n.env.filename=.okta.env\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Okta</code> configuration</p>\n<p>With this and if we want to run the secure version of the application, we can create our build with the following command line:</p>\n<pre><code>gradle -Pprod clean build\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, module moving-objects-gui, provides a GUI to us where we can visualize our applications. We won’t go into details about it, but it is important to understand that we will be deploying it in NGINX, and we will also want to monitor that machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9monitoringendpoints\">9. Monitoring Endpoints</h2>\n<p>\\\n\\\nIn previous steps, we have looked into how the architecture is designed, and we have looked at our domain. We have also had a look at the code and took a dive into some interesting aspects of the implementation. We should have a very clear view of what the system is doing at the moment and how all the moving parts are working. We will now go step-by-step through all the elements of the monitoring system. In this part of the article, it’s important to bear in mind that this system can be run on a local machine. All moving parts are part of a <code>docker-compose</code> setup. In this article, I wanted to make an example that would be easy to understand and modify and this is why every single component has its own custom Docker image. Also, let’s keep in mind that the examples I’m showing happen after we have successfully run <code>docker-compose</code>. Further in this article, we’ll go through the details. For now, let’s keep in mind that we can run two versions of our system. For the secure version, we can run:</p>\n<pre><code>make dcup-full-action-secure\n</code></pre>\n<p>or if we want to run it without okta, we can then run:</p>\n<pre><code>make dcup-full-action\n</code></pre>\n<p>For now, let’s have a look at how the metrics can be configured in the different containers. For our example, we have 3 containers with important metric configuration needs. They are the moving-objects-jwt-service, the moving-objects-rest-service, and the moving-objects-gui . For the first two services, we need to configure Prometheus for Spring Boot:</p>\n<pre><code>implementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator\")\nimplementation(\"io.micrometer:micrometer-core:1.14.2\")\nimplementation(\"io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus:1.14.2\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>Micrometer dependencies</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is the <code>micrometer</code> dependency that is needed to have all metrics written and exposed in the Prometheus format. In order to activate it, we also need to activate the Spring Boot’s actuator. This will still not open the endpoints though. These are actually just the libraries that will allow the endpoints to be generated. To open our endpoints in our project we need to explicitly configure <code>Spring Boot</code> for that:</p>\n<pre><code>management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*\nmanagement.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true\nmanagement.endpoint.metrics.enabled=true\nmanagement.endpoint.prometheus.enabled=true\nmanagement.endpoint.httptrace.enabled=true\nmanagement.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true\nmanagement.trace.http.enabled=true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Enabling Metrics including Prometheus</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nBoth rest services contain the same configuration. The actuator is needed because it provides important metrics that come out of the box in <code>Spring Boot</code> and can already be indirectly read by Prometheus. The micrometer properties from the <code>io.micrometer</code> core and the prometheus libraries provide metrics using the same format as Prometheus. This allows for a much easier data reading in the Prometheus processes from the metrics endpoints.With these simple configuration lines, we are enabling endpoints to be created, and we are also activating other tracking mechanisms. All of these management points are part of the <code>Spring Boot</code> Actuator. However, a <code>Prometheus</code> actuator endpoint is only autoconfigured in the presence of the <code>Spring Boot</code> Actuator. Hence, the reason for needing the micrometer libraries and the actuator libraries simultaneously.<code>Prometheus</code> has its own scrappers. They will run processes against <code>Spring Boot</code> applications and scrape all of those metrics periodically. We can also make our own metrics and make them available through the actuator. There are many different ways of doing this and one example is to play a bit with trace. In our metrics we can find this endpoint:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost:8080/objects/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests\">http://localhost:8080/objects/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the result we find:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fggl41r3anf9p7ohywdg4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Unchanged payload to trace requests</p>\n<p>\\\nHere we have <code>COUNT</code>, <code>TOTAL_TIME</code>, and <code>MAX</code>. These are in their essence, the number of requests made to the application, the total time they took to respond, and the maximum time it took to get a response from a request. These are all important metrics. With these metrics, we can have an idea of how many people are looking into our web application. For ratings, it’s a very handy metric. We want to monitor the performance of our application. Using total time can be an option. With Prometheus, we have much better options than this, but since we have count and total time, we can actually get the average response time for a certain endpoint. As shown, we can also read the maximum time an endpoint took to respond. This can be important when noticing that if one endpoint exceeds a certain time to respond then that endpoint may have a latency issue. Therefore some sort of action must be made in terms of improving it. What we don’t have in these metrics, is the minimum amount of time it took for an endpoint to reply. We just don’t have data for that. At no point, we have registered the time of each request. The alternative to that is to implement our own <code>HttpTraceRepository</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>@Repository\npublic class CustomTraceRepository implements HttpExchangeRepository {\n    private final AtomicReference&lt;Queue&lt;HttpExchange&gt;&gt; lastTrace = new AtomicReference&lt;&gt;(new LinkedList&lt;&gt;());\n\n    @Override\n    public List&lt;HttpExchange&gt; findAll() {\n        try {\n            return new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(lastTrace.get());\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            return List.of();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void add(HttpExchange trace) {\n        val httpTraces = lastTrace.get();\n        if (httpTraces.size() &gt; 10) {\n            while (httpTraces.size() &gt; 10) {\n                httpTraces.poll();\n            }\n        }\n        if (\"GET\".equals(trace.getRequest().getMethod())) {\n            httpTraces.add(trace);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>CustomTraceRepository</p>\n<p>\\\nThis creates an implementation of the HTTP tracing, This has been enabled by the <code>HTTP</code> tracing flag as we saw before: <code>management.trace.http.enabled=true</code>. We can notice already that this implementation also carries a repository. Simply speaking, I just created a <code>FIFO</code> (<code>First In/ First Out</code>) queue. In other words, I’m just keeping 10 elements in the repository at the time. This code is only responsible for the recording of <code>GET</code> requests. We can change this to perform other or the same operation to other requests. The focus here is just the fact that we can change metrics the way we please and reprogram some of them to report customized data directly into Prometheus or any other monitoring fetching tool. Traces will carry the following format as an example:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6nasedrjdit9d9ix1y7f.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Renewed Trace Metric Request</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\nIf we look at the last element of this request, we find timeTaken. This is the response time of each GET request. Our MIN could in this case be an implementation of the minimum timeTaken in this array. It’s important to notice that in this case, we are measuring milliseconds. Why is the minimum time needed? Perhaps our intention is to find the peaks in our performance instead of the peaks in memory usage or CPU. Perhaps if we know when our requests were faster, we can then also identify where we potentially had a better code or system as a whole. This endpoint is accessible in this project on endpoint <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/aggregator/actuator/httptrace\">http://localhost:8080/aggregator/actuator/httptrace</a>.We just went through the essentials for the <code>Spring Boot</code> back-end support for Prometheus. Let’s have a look at how <code>NodeJS</code> can provide the same endpoint for <code>Prometheus</code>. In our example, we have a fully developed application in <code>Angular</code>. We could have used <code>NGINX</code> to deploy it directly. However, in that case, <code>NGINX</code> itself would have had to have been configured in order to provide the endpoints to <code>Prometheus</code>. However, <code>NodeJS</code> provides a very interesting solution by means of the libraries: prometheus-api-metrics and prom-client.There is a <strong>server.ts</strong> example in the code, but our focus will only be at this point on two crucial lines of that code:</p>\n<pre><code>import \"es6-shim\";\nimport moment from \"moment\";\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\n\nimport apiMetrics from \"prometheus-api-metrics\";\n\nimport express from \"express\";\n\nclass Server {\n\n    public static bootstrap(): Server {\n        return new Server();\n    }\n\n    public app: any;\n    private port = 4000;\n\n    constructor() {\n        this.app = express();\n        this.app.use(apiMetrics());\n        // tslint:disable-next-line:no-console\n        this.app.listen(this.port, () =&gt; console.log(`Express http is started ${this.port}`));\n        this.app.on(\"error\", (error: any) =&gt; {\n            // tslint:disable-next-line:no-console\n            console.error(moment().format(), \"An error has ocurred!\", error);\n        });\n        process.on(\"uncaughtException\", (error: any) =&gt; {\n            // tslint:disable-next-line:no-console\n            console.log(moment().format(), error);\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nconst server = Server.bootstrap();\nexport default server.app;\n</code></pre>\n<p>server.ts metrics supplier</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nThe lines we are interested in, or should I just say the one line we care about is: this.app.use(apiMetrics());The whole server.ts is an implementation of a simple NodeJS service that runs on express. Our endpoints for <code>Prometheus</code> metrics can be seen in our running example on endpoints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost:8080/objects/actuator/prometheus\">http://localhost:8080/objects/actuator/prometheus</a> — <code>JWT</code> Service</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost:8080/aggregator/actuator/prometheus\">http://localhost:8080/aggregator/actuator/prometheus</a> — <code>Okta</code> Service</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost:8080/metrics\">http://localhost:8080/metrics</a> — <code>NGINX</code> Service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The metric format will be something like this:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Farkmp2r6esyva9p3tk1l.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Example metrics exposed by Prometheus enabled</p>\n<h2 id=\"11settingupprometheus\">11. Setting up Prometheus</h2>\n<p>To get <code>Prometheus</code> running, we finally need to configure all of what we have discussed into a prometheus.yml file. Our file looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>global:\n  scrape_interval:     15s\n  evaluation_interval: 30s\n\nscrape_configs:\n\n  - job_name: aggregator-reactive-rest\n    honor_timestamps: true\n    metrics_path: /aggregator/actuator/prometheus\n    static_configs:\n      - targets:\n          - moving-objects-rest-service:8082\n\n  - job_name: objects-jwt-reactive-rest\n    honor_timestamps: true\n    metrics_path: /objects/actuator/prometheus\n    static_configs:\n      - targets:\n          - moving-objects-jwt-service:8081\n\n  - job_name: moving-objects-gui\n    honor_timestamps: true\n    metrics_path: /metrics\n    static_configs:\n      - targets:\n          - nginx:4000\n</code></pre>\n<p>Full Prometheus configuration file</p>\n<p>Notice that at the end, the configuration is pointing to our <code>InfluxDB</code>. We would be setting our scrapping interval to 15 seconds, and we would evaluate each scrape for the past 30 seconds. However, those two lines are no longer usable. <code>InfluxDB</code> has grown into its own scrapper framework which opens the debate of Prometheus is still a necessary thing. Here, however, we are just looking at ways to configure our monitoring application. What is important though, is that we see that we can configure our routes in a YAML fashion with property static_configs. In all three, we configure three different jobs that will scrape the data we need. Scrapping in this case means that the data will be accessible to any external visualizing tool like the Grafana framework we’ll see further on.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbmnjdu3ipdrkrm6sunap.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Prometheus Dashboard</p>\n<h2 id=\"12settingupinfluxdb\">12. Setting up <code>InfluxDB</code></h2>\n<p>\\\nOne of the greatest hurdles with working with any architecture is the persistence layer. <code>Prometheus</code> does not provide an easy-to-configure durable and persistent storage system. This is something that is expected from <code>Prometheus</code>, given that <code>Prometheus</code> is mostly used as a scrapper, and as we have seen before it is not easy to get it from being an ephemeral data storage system to a persistent data storage system. This is why we have such databases as <code>InfluxDB</code>. This is a storage system specifically designed to store metrics. Current days, it provides much more features, and it has its own data scrappers that work pretty much in the same way as <code>Prometheus</code> does. Let’s have a look at how we can connect to it.<code>InfluxDB</code> does not need to be connected to <code>Prometheus</code> to store metrics anymore. In the old days, we would configure <code>Prometheus</code> to push the data to <code>InfluxDB</code> by means of Jobs. In current days we just need metric endpoints. Then <code>InfluxDB</code> can scrape those metrics and can even provide visualization graphics and dashboards, much in the way Grafana does. We can have it running and just use it within our system. To check that it’s actually up and running we can just run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>influx ping\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n\\\nFor this, we need to have the influx client installed. When starting the demo locally, Cypress will run through the current <code>InfluxDB</code> installation, and it will create buckets and scrapers. These will be configured to store data in different buckets for different endpoints. <code>InfluxDB</code> comes itself with <code>Prometheus</code> metrics endpoints. Configuring <code>InfluxDB</code> from the GUI is very easy and I don’t think it is relevant to show how these buckets and scrappers get configured. However, it is important to visualize what we get after the run is successfully completed. This is what we get after configuring the buckets. When we run Cypress the first thing it creates is the buckets for our scrappers to save the data:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhohri83vmaznf58ytbdu.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>When the <code>buckets</code> are created, we can now create the scrappers:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6j85ix8eioz8ka33gvvf.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Scrappers in InfluxDB</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nAnd finally, we can create an Application Token:<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F08iszeblft5cuazoemiu.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Application Token in Influx DB</p>\n<p>This application token is needed for something very interesting in <code>InfluxDB</code>, which made it into an even more independent platform. As we see from above, <code>InfluxDB</code> allows to actively scrape metrics from our applications. This is all good, but we may want to this the other way around. If we want to passively receive data in <code>InfluxDB</code>, we then need an external tool to do that. <code>Prometheus</code> has that functionality still, but, because of the security requirements, it is quite cumbersome to achieve it. <code>InfluxDB</code>, however, allows for external engines to connect with it quite easily including the ones provided by <code>Prometheus</code>. They all have this concept <code>Telegraf</code>. A <code>Telegraf</code> is essentially a tool that loads these engines and starts actively collecting data from a <code>Prometheus</code> payload and pushes it to <code>InfluxDB</code>. We do not need to download or install anything other than <code>Telegraf</code> to do this and to configure it, we can edit the <code>telegraf.conf</code> file. For our project, it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>## Collect Prometheus formatted metrics\n[[inputs.prometheus]]\n  urls = [\n  \"http://localhost:8080/objects/actuator/prometheus\",\n  \"http://localhost:8080/aggregator/actuator/prometheus\",\n  \"http://localhost:8080/metrics\"\n  ]\n  metric_version = 2\n\n## Write Prometheus formatted metrics to InfluxDB\n[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]\n  urls = [\"http://localhost:8086\"]\n  token = \"$INFLUX_TOKEN\"\n  organization = \"Moving Objects\"\n  bucket = \"mos\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nInfluxDB</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nThe important thing for now is just to focus a bit on the self-explanatory parameters of this file. Essentially we need urls to let <code>telegraf</code> know where to scrape our metrics from, and we need to specify the destination of those metrics. For the destination, we need to provide the location of <code>InfluxDB</code> with urls, the token we’ve generated before, the organization, and the bucket. It is important to understand that the unique identifiers of our location in <code>InfluxDB</code> are organization and bucket. These are mandatory. At the top of these parameters, we specify the type of the metrics source endpoints with inputs.prometheus and the destination type with <code>outputs.influxdb_v2</code>. When running the demo, the build will start, then cypress will run and create the token at /docker-files/telegraf, and it will finally start the telegraf container in the same network of <code>docker-compose</code>. In other words, this will all be done automatically for us so that we can focus on how the setup is made. If we get the demo successfully, with script make start-demo running, we’ll then be able to create graphs like this one:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdgtkvxh7r4v7w7gyu357.jpg\" alt=\"blogcenter\" /></a>Dashboard visualization for InfluxDB</p>\n<p>If you notice that data isn’t coming in, it could be that <code>telegraf</code> hasn’t started yet. We can start telegraf again by running:</p>\n<pre><code>make start-telegraf-container\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"13settingupgrafana\">13. Setting up Grafana</h2>\n<p><code>Grafana</code> has a different way of configuring than <code>Prometheus</code>. Here we don’t need any code. Grafana is based purely on the contract it has with <code>Prometheus</code>. Before continuing, let’s recap what we have so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 <code>Spring Boot</code> applications and 1 <code>NodeJS</code> application</li>\n<li>Persistent Metrics Database <code>InfluxDB</code></li>\n<li>Metrics Scrapper and management with <code>Prometheus</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nWe will use <code>Prometheus</code> with <code>Grafana</code> to generate graphs from <code>Prometheus</code> only. A detailed discussion on how graphics are built with <code>Grafana</code> is a topic on its own and removes the focus of this article. What’s important to understand is how can we make our <code>Grafana</code> configuration also persistent. We want to keep our graphic configuration persistent so that we can use them in any <code>Grafana</code> environment. When we look at <code>Grafana</code> for the first time, we become immediately aware that we have to create a data source. With this action, we also create a Dashboard provider. Dashboard providers are kept in YAML files located in /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/ in <code>Grafana</code>. Let’s look at our example on dashboard.yml:</p>\n<pre><code>apiVersion: 1\n\nproviders:\n  - name: 'Prometheus'\n    orgId: 1\n    folder: ''\n    type: file\n    disableDeletion: false\n    editable: true\n    options:\n      path: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n<code>Grafana</code> <code>Dashboard</code> configuration</p>\n<p>With this <code>configuration</code>, we are telling <code>Grafana</code> that <code>Prometheus</code> is the name of its first <code>Dashboard</code> provider. At the same time, we are letting Grafana know that we will load all dashboards located in <code>/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards</code>. Although we have already established a data provider for our dashboards, we still need the actual endpoint for <code>Prometheus</code>. This is done in our datasource.yml file:</p>\n<pre><code>apiVersion: 1\n\ndeleteDatasources:\n  - name: Prometheus\n    orgId: 1\n\ndatasources:\n  - name: Prometheus\n    type: prometheus\n    access: proxy\n    orgId: 1\n    url: http://prometheus:9090\n    basicAuth: false\n    version: 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\ndatasource.yml</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nAfter defining the data source and the dashboard data provider we finally need to place all our dashboards in <code>/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards</code>. <code>Grafana</code> provides ways to save these dashboards in a <code>JSON</code> format. They do not need to be referenced by <code>Grafana</code>. As long as they reside in that folder, we will see that <code>Grafana</code> will read all of them. The Dashboard themselves are quite big files and they are available in the project in the folder /docker-files/grafana. The two JSON files there are the setup files for the <code>NGINX</code> machine (<code>node-grafana.json</code>) and for the JVM’s (<code>jvm-grafana.json</code>).<code>Grafana</code> seems to have some compatibility issues with Firefox. I do not consider them to be critical, and they are something that I was never able to reproduce in terms of <code>UX</code> (<code>User eXperience</code>). However, they do exist and the cypress tests were able to detect a lot of them, and this is why, if we take a look at commands.ts, we’ll see a few exception rules for certain thrown errors:</p>\n<pre><code>Cypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) =&gt; {\n    if (err.message &amp;&amp; err.message.trim().length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; err.name &amp;&amp; err.name.trim().length &gt; 0) {\n        if (err.message.indexOf('setting getter-only property \"data\"') &gt;= 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (err.message.indexOf('Cannot read properties of null') &gt;= 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (err.message.indexOf('too much recursion') &gt;= 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (err.message.indexOf('The operation was aborted') &gt;= 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (err.message.indexOf('undefined') &gt;= 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAfter running Grafana, we should be getting graphs like these:</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fft89vexqtusrhd2p5nsu.jpg\" alt=\"blogcenter\" />   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F58c9k67aqescgkdlzi06.jpg\" alt=\"blogcenter\" /></a><code>Dasboards</code> examples for Grafana</p>\n<h2 id=\"14dockercomposerorchestration\">14. Docker composer orchestration</h2>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>docker-compose</code> file located at the root of the project contains the main setup to start the application. This is how we implement our <code>docker-compose</code> orchestration as seen in our first diagram.I mentioned before a few ways to start this application locally. We can try and run it all in one go. The script available to do this is the start demo:</p>\n<pre><code>make start-demo\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nIf this is successful, we will start the insecure version of our application. we want to start the secure application we can then run:</p>\n<pre><code>make start-demo-secure\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThis is the look of our page at port 8080:</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">   <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvl51m8sn52u24nyelmnh.jpg\" alt=\"blogcenter\" /></a>Moving Objects application</p>\n<h2 id=\"15conclusion\">15. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We have finally reached the end of this article. It is quite extended, but I hope to have been able to transmit the essential points I found to be of inspiration with this sort of Monitoring architecture. I didn’t want it to become too complicated but I also wanted to make it a fun article with a few surprises. In this article, we have seen how to set up a very basic configuration of <code>Prometheus</code>, <code>Grafana</code> and <code>InfluxDB</code> applied to <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>NodeJS</code> applications. We have seen images as examples of how the Dashboards look and feel. Looking back to all three types of dashboards and the three different brands, we can immediately get the idea that these are essentially just different monitoring tools and they can all be based on simple <code>Prometheus</code> metrics endpoints. We can also see that we can make our own metrics and that those can be programmed in the code. It can be overwhelming to make a decision when using these mechanisms. For example, Grafana, seems to be a great tool to visualize data and although we have seen in this article, how to integrate it with the <code>Prometheus</code> service, we can also integrate it with <code>InfluxDB</code>. But now maybe we get a bit taken aback because <code>InfluxDB</code> itself has Dashboards, so why do we need Grafana anyway? Maybe there are functionalities in Grafana that you cannot find in <code>InfluxDB</code>. Or perhaps, in the same way, Telegraf, can lower the CPU usage of <code>InfluxDB</code>, and so can Grafana. In fact, Grafana can be considered just a visualization framework, <code>Prometheus</code> the source of all metrics, <code>InfluxDB</code> the persistence database, and Telegraf, the scrapper we need. If we do it this way, then we get a completely decoupled system where each part has its own responsibility. Therefore, we minimize performance issues and the influence of metrics on our application. So, in regard to security, using <code>JWT</code> and <code>Okta</code> as authentication/authorization mechanisms, we can see that in order to be able to monitor we can make the endpoints open. But should we? We probably should not leave them open, but they frequently are open. What usually happens is that they remain open for the in-premise network, but to the outside world, they are kept private. So this means that not even someone with full access is able to access these endpoints. The techniques to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but solutions such as <code>NGINX</code>, Kong, and other gateways are available to provide functionality, and they usually offer integrations with <code>Cloud</code> providers. I have placed all the source code of this application on <a href=\"https://github.com/jesperancinha/moving-objects-service-root\">GitHub</a> hope that you have enjoyed this article as much as I enjoyed writing it.

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Record: Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered dozens of attacks that involve malicious updates for Chrome browser extensions, one week after a security firm was compromised in a similar incident. As of Wednesday, a total of 36 Chrome extensions injected with data-stealing code have been detected, mostly related to artificial intelligence (AI) tools and virtual private networks (VPNs), according to a report by ExtensionTotal, a platform that analyzes extensions listed on various marketplaces and public registries. These extensions, collectively used by roughly 2.6 million people, include third-party tools such as ChatGPT for Google Meet, Bard AI Chat, YesCaptcha Assistant, VPNCity and Internxt VPN. Some of the affected companies have already addressed the issue by removing the compromised extensions from the store or updating them, according to ExtensionTotal's analysis. [...]\n \nIt remains unclear whether all the compromised extensions are linked to the same threat actor. Security researchers warn that browser extensions \"shouldn't be treated lightly,\" as they have deep access to browser data, including authenticated sessions and sensitive information. Extensions are also easy to update and often not subjected to the same scrutiny as traditional software. ExtensionTotal recommends that organizations use only pre-approved versions of extensions and ensure they remain unchanged and protected from malicious automatic updates. \"Even when we trust the developer of an extension, it's crucial to remember that every version could be entirely different from the previous one,\" researchers said. \"If the extension developer is compromised, the users are effectively compromised as well -- almost instantly.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Hackers+Target+Dozens+of+VPN%2C+AI+Extensions+For+Google+Chrome+To+Compromise+Data%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F2157246%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F2157246%2Fhackers-target-dozens-of-vpn-ai-extensions-for-google-chrome-to-compromise-data%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/2157246/hackers-target-dozens-of-vpn-ai-extensions-for-google-chrome-to-compromise-data?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567529&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>Companies are now turning to data as one of the most important assets in their businesses, and data engineers are in the midst of managing and improving this asset and its effectiveness. In addition, the integration of data engineering with the use of cloud computing offers scalability, accessibility, and reduced expenses. However, there are security challenges that come with this integration that need to be solved. </p>\n<p>\\\nIt is essential to know the rates and causes of cloud security incidents in order to identify the vulnerabilities of the cloud systems. The cost of security incidents in businesses has shockingly<a href=\"https://engage.checkpoint.com/2024-cloud-security-report\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://engage.checkpoint.com/2024-cloud-security-report\">increased to 61% in 2024</a></strong> from the previous year’s 24%.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs a data engineer, you are in a position to manage the flow of data in a society that is constantly in evolution. This responsibility is very important in today’s organizations, and if not given due attention, it can affect its overall performance. With the increasing use of <strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-types-and-benefits-of-cloud-computing-wgcl354y?ref=hackernoon.com\">cloud technology</a></strong>, it has led to an increase in the frequency of migration processes. </p>\n<p>\\\nIt is now evident that cloud security is no more a concern only within the IT department. It has become a crucial factor in the overall business process and productivity. Why is this so important? It is because any wrongdoing or negligence in the system may lead to adverse consequences such as system failures that interrupt business flow, bad image, and breach of data privacy.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, a problem I often see businesses struggle with is that they have their cloud platforms varied and the security tools they use are specific to each ecosystem including the AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Services. It is possible to become an expert in one system, and this may not allow you to easily transfer your skills to another system.</p>\n<p>\\\nThat said, there is a solution to this challenge in the form of an approach that can work on any platform. This means that one can find a number of security principles and practices that are not aligned with any particular vendor to develop a solution that can scale across different clouds. In this piece, I’ll list down the basic principles that a data engineer should know about cloud security and share some insights on the current developments in the field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keyfundamentalsofcloudsecurityfordataengineers\"><strong>Key Fundamentals of Cloud Security for Data Engineers</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"dataencryption\"><strong>Data Encryption</strong></h3>\n<p>Encryption is one of the most effective methods of ensuring that information cannot be obtained by unauthorized persons with ease. When data is stored (At Rest) on the cloud, generally, there are commonly used encryption standards such as Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) with a 256-bit key by the leading cloud service providers. For instance, in AWS, users can simply secure their S3 storage buckets by configuring the encryption settings.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/TZ805oC8djTv5f7LS545bWeJw4y2-22534zp.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>To secure data while it’s being transferred from one point to another point (In Transit) on the network, infrastructure upholds TLS (Transport Layer Security) which encrypts communication between services.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/TZ805oC8djTv5f7LS545bWeJw4y2-jq634do.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"accesscontrolandidentitymanagement\"><strong>Access Control and Identity Management</strong></h3>\n<p>The allocation of access control helps in preventing the occurrence of attacks by implementing the notion of least privilege to users and applications and granting them only the required access to perform their tasks on the cloud platforms such as GCP IAM, AWS IAM, or Azure Active Directory where administrators use tools for permission and identity management. The provided example showcases an IAM policy in AWS designed specifically for limiting access to S3 buckets.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/TZ805oC8djTv5f7LS545bWeJw4y2-ai734zw.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"networksecurity\"><strong>Network Security</strong></h3>\n<p>The basic infrastructure of cloud security comprises a network system that has features such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), network access control lists (NACLs), and firewalls that regulate incoming and outgoing traffic. For instance, in Azure, we can create a Network Security Group (NSG) to filter traffic as shown below.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/TZ805oC8djTv5f7LS545bWeJw4y2-6q834e3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"securedatastorageandprocessing\"><strong>Secure Data Storage and Processing</strong></h3>\n<p>Cloud data must be kept safe while still being easily accessible for processing purposes. Technologies like Bucket Lock in Google Cloud Storage and AWS S3 Object Lock are designed with features that enable immutable data storage in the native environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monitoringandauditing\"><strong>Monitoring and Auditing</strong></h3>\n<p>This makes it possible to detect threats in cloud environments since user actions and system events are examined as well as AWS CloudTrail or Azure Monitor logs for any anomalies. Here is a demonstration of how to activate CloudTrail for an AWS account.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/TZ805oC8djTv5f7LS545bWeJw4y2-q2934p5.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"complianceanddatagovernance\"><strong>Compliance and Data Governance</strong></h3>\n<p>Compliance frameworks like GDPR or HIPPA and standards such as SOC 2 require data engineers to incorporate security measures to protect sensitive data adequately. In order to remain compliant with the regulations in place and maintain security standards for information classification and tagging of data, these processes should be conducted by data engineers in collaboration with relevant security teams. </p>\n<p>\\\nAs an example of this practice in action, Azure Purview has the capability to automatically categorize data based on the policies that have been applied.</p>\n<h3 id=\"securingdatapipelines\"><strong>Securing Data Pipelines</strong></h3>\n<p>Data pipelines can also be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks or incorrect configuration if misshapen by individuals in the middle of a communication channel or if settings are misapplied or misaligned. When choosing among the available candidates for your data pipeline, it is recommended to use either AWS Glue or Apache Airflow as they both provide ways of connecting to your data in a secure manner. </p>\n<p>\\\nFor example, the following is a sample setup guide on Apache Airflow which demonstrates the application of an encryption process for enhancing security.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/TZ805oC8djTv5f7LS545bWeJw4y2-9ya34yi.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"emergingcloudsecuritytrends\"><strong>Emerging Cloud Security Trends</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"dealingwithaninfluxofdata\"><strong>Dealing With an Influx of Data</strong></h3>\n<p>The issue of<a href=\"https://www.stationx.net/cloud-security-statistics/?ref=hackernoon.com\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.stationx.net/cloud-security-statistics/?ref=hackernoon.com\">data volume</a></strong> in cloud environments is a double-edged sword as it creates as many benefits as it does challenges. It’s a well-known fact that the volume of data alone can be quite daunting for tools to manage. The real difficulty, however, does not reside in the capture of data but in the analysis of it - identifying correlations in order to recognize trends and anomalies as well as predicting security threats.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>\\\nNevertheless, data engineers can employ technologies that go beyond the standard ones and are enhanced by<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-cloud-security-innovative-cybersecurity-solutions-for-cloud-based-environments\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-cloud-security-innovative-cybersecurity-solutions-for-cloud-based-environments\">analytical power, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning.</a></strong> These techniques have the potential to take the currently unstructured data streams and turn them into valuable insights that enhance the overall security posture within the continuously evolving digital environments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zerotrustarchitecture\"><strong>Zero Trust Architecture</strong></h3>\n<p>The traditional security model which is based on the concept of perimeter defense is slowly being phased out and giving way to the new<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-does-zero-trust-architecture-strengthen-security-in-multi-cloud-environments?ref=hackernoon.com\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-does-zero-trust-architecture-strengthen-security-in-multi-cloud-environments?ref=hackernoon.com\">zero trust model</a></strong>. The basic tenet of zero trust is based on the premise that no component whether it is a user or a device should be trusted automatically. </p>\n<p>\\\nA major advantage of this methodology is that it focuses on the validation of the user identity, the device, and the access rights that are to be granted. Thus, employing tools that are compatible with various platforms enables data engineers and security personnel to adopt this very effective protective measure in different cloud environments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thedevelopmentofcloudsecurityproducts\"><strong>The Development of Cloud Security Products</strong></h3>\n<p>In a world where cloud services are commonly used and architecture is rather complex, securing systems throughout the systems is not an easy task. This has led to the development of <a href=\"https://www.itpro.com/business/what-are-the-benefits-of-unified-cloud-security#:~:text=Unified%20cloud%20security%20refers%20to,as%20a%20Service%20(SaaS).\">cloud security management tools</a>, which ideally should be able to integrate with other tools to enhance the work of the security teams. The main aim is to enforce the implementation of security policies and gain control and visibility of the different cloud stacks. This should ensure that security measures are put in place irrespective of the technology that underlies it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insummary\"><strong>In Summary</strong></h2>\n<p>Security in the changing world of the cloud is like going on an adventure, and that is a good thing. It is important to deal with security concerns and vulnerabilities when they surface - this puts you in the lead. Zero trust frameworks offer important validations when it comes to handling security issues while the unified security architecture guarantees that policies are well enforced and there is a proper view. </p>\n<p>\\\nBut the architectural design of cloud environments is still in the process of evolving, and they need to be adaptable and proactive in order to enhance the shielding. </p>\n<p>\\\nAlthough all the strategies mentioned here and the ongoing efforts to match up with the advancements can be used to enhance the security of major cloud infrastructure, the threat cannot be entirely ruled out. \\n </p>",

For example, name, profession, and personal interests.</h2>\n<p>Hi! I’m Thomas Cherickal from Kerala living in Chennai, India, working as a <strong>Freelance Technological Content Writer</strong>. I have a Master’s Degree in Computer Science but I never took to Software Development and left commercial software development after two years for full-time writing. However, I have kept up a keen interest in software and I never stopped learning all the new languages and ML/AI frameworks because that learning catalyzes my original articles. I also subscribe to Academia.edu and I keep up with the latest research on AI, ML, Quantum Computing, Blockchain, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI, Large Language Models, and the fusion of any of the aforementioned. This constant input has been vital to my writing as well, and my work on competitive programming sites like LeetCode and HackerRank has kept my coding skills sharp.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interestingwhatwasyourlatesthackernoontopstoryabout\">Interesting! What was your latest Hackernoon Top story about?</h2>\n<p>My last top story of the day spoke about <strong>why humanity has to race towards AGI</strong> because the country that achieves AGI and therefore ASI (through the AGI’s help) will have a huge advantage over those catching up to AGI/ASI. Also, while we may talk of ethical implications, other countries will have no such qualms. I would like ASI to be kept out of the hands of a dictatorship. The US may have its own problems, technocrats, and oligarchs, but the openness and the democratic nature of its technology and society means that it might be a good thing for the world if AGI was first developed in the US.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doyouusuallywriteonsimilartopicsifnotwhatdoyouusuallywriteabout\">Do you usually write on similar topics? If not, what do you usually write about?</h2>\n<p><strong>I write about emerging technologies,</strong> and ideas that have the power to change the world, and I often take on the role of predicting the future while explaining a current emerging technology. I also write about fusing different domains, e.g., my recent popular article about the synergy between AI and Quantum Computing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"greatwhatisyourusualwritingroutinelikeifyouhaveone\">Great! What is your usual writing routine like (if you have one?)</h2>\n<p><strong>Input.</strong> I focus on input because learning new things always gives me ideas. Once I have that idea, I dig deeper with research papers and books on the topic and then focus on an engaging take that would add genuine value to the reader. I like to think that keeping up with the research gives me a bleeding-edge perspective on emerging technology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beingawriterintechcanbeachallengeitsnotoftenourmainrolebutanadditiontoanotheronewhatisthebiggestchallengeyouhavewhenitcomestowriting\">Being a writer in tech can be a challenge. It’s not often our main role, but an addition to another one. What is the biggest challenge you have when it comes to writing?</h2>\n<p><strong>Monetization</strong>. I have nearly 300 stories online on five different platforms, but I should have focused on monetization earlier. I am just discovering Gumroad. I am happy to say that Medium has started its Partner program in India and I’m eagerly looking forward to the months ahead. Unfortunately, <strong>my favorite platform, Substack, still does not support monetization for Indian writers.</strong> I sincerely hope that the Substack Team makes monetization in many more countries, especially a writing powerhouse like India, a major priority.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthenextthingyouhopetoachieveinyourcareer\">What is the next thing you hope to achieve in your career?</h2>\n<p><strong>I would love to find new ways to monetize and be creative when it comes to earning money.</strong> Ghostwriting pays well, but I’m looking at moving into digital products on Gumroad. And yes, a series of mini-ebooks. No AI-generated writing is allowed, of course. <strong>I also want to remain at the forefront of the race to AGI/ASI.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"wowthatsadmirablenowsomethingmorecasualwhatisyourguiltypleasureofchoice\">Wow, that’s admirable. Now, something more casual: What is your guilty pleasure of choice?</h2>\n<p><strong>Music.</strong> I was in a four-part acapella choir for many years and thoroughly enjoyed it. Singing a cappella was actually the main factor behind my move from development to writing—I did not want to stop my musical joy. I am a member of the Jesus Youth movement and sing and play violin for churches, prayer meetings, and night vigils. My born-again Christian identity is something very precious to me, and I enjoy playing and singing for daily mass as a Charismatic Catholic Christian and Jesus Youth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doyouhaveanontechrelatedhobby\">Do you have a non-tech-related hobby?</h2>\n<p>Music, as just explained. Religious music, to be specific.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcanthehackernooncommunityexpecttoreadfromyounext\">What can the Hacker Noon community expect to read from you next?</h2>\n<p>Currently, I’m investigating quantum computing, and learning about current possibly viable applications. You can expect quantum computing articles and reports from the frontiers of Quantum-Classical hybrid computing. I will also be writing about programming in Golang, Dart/Flutter, and Rust.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsyouropiniononhackernoonasaplatformforwriters\">What’s your opinion on HackerNoon as a platform for writers?</h2>\n<p><strong>I strongly believe that it is high time that HackerNoon focused on active monetization for its writers.</strong> Maybe a blockchain-based pay-per-view micro-transaction-based monetization system by charging a nominal subscription fee for readers with country-wise parity pricing. Medium-style. Considering that most readers are technologists, they will easily be able to afford it. HackerNoon could lead the way to adopt the world’s first major blockchain-based writer payment system. There are others, but HackerNoon is a major platform, and this is an idea whose time has come.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"thanksfortakingtimetojoinourmeetthewriterhttpshackernooncomtaggedmeetthewriterseriesitwasapleasuredoyouhaveanyclosingwords\">Thanks for taking time to join our “<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/tagged/meet-the-writer\">Meet the writer</a>” series. It was a pleasure. Do you have any closing words?</h2>\n<p><strong>Whoever is reading this, believe in yourself. Believe in your dreams and the ability to make them real.</strong> Don’t be afraid to dream big and shoot for the stars when you write down your goals. That way, you might hit the moon! I have found joy and peace in my current lifestyle, and am entering a time of self-discovery and financial freedom. <strong>I repeat, dream big, follow your passion, and work hard. Put your heart and soul into it. The money will follow.</strong> Thanks for having me!</p>",

      "content": "President Vladimir Putin has directed Russia's government and the country's biggest bank, Sberbank, to strengthen AI cooperation with China, aiming to overcome Western sanctions and challenge U.S. dominance in AI innovation. Reuters reports: Putin's instructions were published on the Kremlin's website on Wednesday, three weeks after he announced that Russia would team up with BRICS partners and other countries to develop AI. He told the government and Sberbank, which is spearheading Russia's AI efforts, to \"ensure further co-operation with the People's Republic of China in technological research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.\"\n \nWestern sanctions intended to restrict Moscow's access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world's major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, severely limiting its AI ambitions. Sberbank CEO German Gref acknowledged in 2023 that graphics processing units (GPUs), the microchips that underpin AI development, were the trickiest hardware for Russia to replace.\n \nBy partnering with non-Western countries, Russia is seeking to challenge the dominance of the United States in one of the most promising and crucial technologies of the 21st century. Putin said on Dec. 11 that a new AI Alliance Network would bring together specialists from BRICS countries and other interested states.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Putin+Orders+Russian+Government+and+Top+Bank+To+Develop+AI+Cooperation+With+China%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F2140216%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F2140216%2Fputin-orders-russian-government-and-top-bank-to-develop-ai-cooperation-with-china%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/2140216/putin-orders-russian-government-and-top-bank-to-develop-ai-cooperation-with-china?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567505&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Apple has agreed (PDF) to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that its voice assistant Siri routinely recorded private conversations that were then sold to third parties for targeted ads. In the proposed class-action settlement (PDF) -- which comes after five years of litigation -- Apple admitted to no wrongdoing. Instead, the settlement refers to \"unintentional\" Siri activations that occurred after the \"Hey, Siri\" feature was introduced in 2014, where recordings were apparently prompted without users ever saying the trigger words, \"Hey, Siri.\" Sometimes Siri would be inadvertently activated, a whistleblower told The Guardian, when an Apple Watch was raised and speech was detected. The only clue that users seemingly had of Siri's alleged spying was eerily accurate targeted ads that appeared after they had just been talking about specific items like Air Jordans or brands like Olive Garden, Reuters noted. It's currently unknown how many customers were affected, but if the settlement is approved, the tech giant has offered up to $20 per Siri-enabled device for any customers who made purchases between September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024. That includes iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, HomePods, iPod touches, and Apple TVs, the settlement agreement noted. Each customer can submit claims for up to five devices.\n \nA hearing when the settlement could be approved is currently scheduled for February 14. If the settlement is certified, Apple will send notices to all affected customers. Through the settlement, customers can not only get monetary relief but also ensure that their private phone calls are permanently deleted. While the settlement appears to be a victory for Apple users after months of mediation, it potentially lets Apple off the hook pretty cheaply. If the court had certified the class action and Apple users had won, Apple could've been fined more than $1.5 billion under the Wiretap Act alone, court filings showed. But lawyers representing Apple users decided to settle, partly because data privacy law is still a \"developing area of law imposing inherent risks that a new decision could shift the legal landscape as to the certifiability of a class, liability, and damages,\" the motion to approve the settlement agreement said. It was also possible that the class size could be significantly narrowed through ongoing litigation, if the court determined that Apple users had to prove their calls had been recorded through an incidental Siri activation -- potentially reducing recoverable damages for everyone.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Siri+'Unintentionally'+Recorded+Private+Convos%3B+Apple+Agrees+To+Pay+%2495+Million%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F2134211%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F2134211%2Fsiri-unintentionally-recorded-private-convos-apple-agrees-to-pay-95-million%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/2134211/siri-unintentionally-recorded-private-convos-apple-agrees-to-pay-95-million?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567503&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Evaluation Protocol</h2>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Datasets.</strong> Following prior research [31, 33], we adopt the Google Scanned Object dataset [13] for our evaluation, which includes a wide variety of common everyday objects. Our evaluation dataset matches that of SyncDreamer [33], comprising 30 objects that span from everyday items to animals. For each object in the evaluation set, we render an image with a size of 256×256, which serves as the input. Additionally, to assess the generalization ability of our model, we include some images with diverse styles collected from the internet in our evaluation.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Metrics.</strong> To evaluate the quality of the single-view reconstructions, we adopt two commonly used metrics Chamfer Distances (CD) and Volume IoU between ground-truth shapes and reconstructed shapes. Since different methods adopt various canonical systems, we first align the generated shapes to the ground-truth shapes before calculating the two metrics. Moreover, we adopt the metrics PSNR, SSIM [62] and LPIPS [74] for evaluating the generated color images.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15008\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Xiaoxiao Long, The University of Hong Kong, VAST, MPI Informatik and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(2) Yuan-Chen Guo, Tsinghua University, VAST and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(3) Cheng Lin, The University of Hong Kong with Corresponding authors;</p>\n<p>(4) Yuan Liu, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(5) Zhiyang Dou, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(6) Lingjie Liu, University of Pennsylvania;</p>\n<p>(7) Yuexin Ma, Shanghai Tech University;</p>\n<p>(8) Song-Hai Zhang, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(9) Marc Habermann, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(10) Christian Theobalt, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(11) Wenping Wang, Texas A&amp;M University with Corresponding authors.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

President Joe Biden signed a 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules. \n\nA three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the FCC lacked authority to reinstate the rules initially implemented in 2015 by the agency under Democratic former President Barack Obama, but then repealed by the commission in 2017 under Republican former President Donald Trump. \n\nThe rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or access to favored users. The court cited the Supreme Court's June decision in a case known as Loper Bright to overturn a 1984 precedent that had given deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer, in the latest decision to curb the authority of federal agencies. \"Applying Loper Bright means we can end the FCC's vacillations,\" the court ruled.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=US+Appeals+Court+Blocks+Biden+Administration+Effort+To+Restore+Net+Neutrality+Rules%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F206258%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F206258%2Fus-appeals-court-blocks-biden-administration-effort-to-restore-net-neutrality-rules%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/206258/us-appeals-court-blocks-biden-administration-effort-to-restore-net-neutrality-rules?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567415&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Experiments</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"51implementationdetails\">5.1. Implementation Details</h3>\n<p>We train our model on the LVIS subset of the Objaverse dataset [9], which comprises approximately 30,000+ objects following a cleanup process. Surprisingly, even with fine-tuning on this relatively small-scale dataset, our method demonstrates robust generalization capabilities. To create the rendered multi-view dataset, we first normalized each object to be centered and of unit scale. Then we render normal maps and color images from six views, including the front, back, left, right, front-right, and front-left views, using Blenderproc [11]. Additionally, to enhance dataset diversity, we applied random rotations to the 3D assets during the rendering process.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe fine-tune our model starting from the Stable Diffusion Image Variations Model, which has previously been fine-tuned with image conditions. We retain the optimizer settings and ϵ-prediction strategy from the previous finetuning. During fine-tuning, we use a reduced image size of 256 × 256 and a total batch size of 512 for training. The fine-tuning process involves training the model for 30,000 steps. This entire training procedure typically requires approximately 3 days on a cluster of 8 Nvidia Tesla A800 GPUs. To reconstruct 3D geometry from the 2D representations, our method is built on the instant-NGP based SDF reconstruction method [19].</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15008\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Xiaoxiao Long, The University of Hong Kong, VAST, MPI Informatik and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(2) Yuan-Chen Guo, Tsinghua University, VAST and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(3) Cheng Lin, The University of Hong Kong with Corresponding authors;</p>\n<p>(4) Yuan Liu, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(5) Zhiyang Dou, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(6) Lingjie Liu, University of Pennsylvania;</p>\n<p>(7) Yuexin Ma, Shanghai Tech University;</p>\n<p>(8) Song-Hai Zhang, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(9) Marc Habermann, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(10) Christian Theobalt, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(11) Wenping Wang, Texas A&amp;M University with Corresponding authors.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

Textured Mesh Extraction</h2>\n<p>To extract explicit 3D geometry from 2D normal maps and color images, we optimize a neural implicit signed distance field (SDF) to amalgamate all 2D generated data. Unlike alternative representations like meshes, SDF offers compactness and differentiability, making them ideal for stable optimization.</p>\n<p>\\\nNonetheless, adopting existing SDF-based reconstruction methods, such as NeuS [60], proves unviable. These methods were tailored for real-captured images and necessitate dense input views. In contrast, our generated views are relatively sparse, and the generated normal maps and color images may exhibit subtle inaccurate predictions of some pixels. Regrettably, these errors accumulate during the geometry optimization, leading to distorted geometries, outliers, and incompleteness. To overcome the challenges above, we propose a novel geometric-aware optimization scheme.</p>\n<p>\\\nOptimization Objectives. With the obtained normal maps G0:N and color images H0:N , we first leverage segmentation models to segment the object masks M0:N from the normal maps or color images. Specifically, we perform the optimization by randomly sampling a batch of pixels and their corresponding rays in world space P = {gk, hk, mk, vk}, where gk is normal value of the kth sampled pixel, hk is color value of the kth pixel, mk ∈ {0, 1} is mask value of the kth pixel, and vk is the direction of the corresponding sampled kth ray, from all views at each iteration.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-nc93xhr.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-m1a3xxi.png\" alt=\"Figure 6. The qualitative comparisons with baseline methods on GSO [13] dataset in terms of the reconstructed textured meshes.\" /></p>\n<p>Geometry-aware Normal Loss. Thanks to the differentiable nature of SDF representation, we can easily extract normal values gˆ of the optimized SDF via calculating the second-order gradients of SDF. We maximize the similarity of the normal of SDF gˆ and our generated normal g to provide 3D geometric supervision. To tolerate trivial inaccuracies of the generated normals from different views, we introduce a geometry-aware normal loss:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-pbb3xfm.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe design rationale behind this approach lies in the orientation of normals, which are deliberately set to face outward, while the viewing direction is inward-facing. This configuration ensures that the angle between the normal vector and the viewing ray remains not less than 90◦ . A deviation from this criterion would imply inaccuracies in the generated normals.</p>\n<p>\\\nFurthermore, it’s worth noting that a 3D point on the optimized shape can be visible from multiple distinct viewpoints, thereby being influenced by multiple normals corresponding to these views. However, if these multiple normals do not exhibit perfect consistency, the geometric supervision may become somewhat ambiguous, leading to imprecise geometry. To address this issue, rather than treating normals from different views equally, we introduce a weighting mechanism. We assign higher weights to normals that form larger angles with the viewing rays. This prioritization enhances the accuracy of our geometric supervision process.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Outlier-dropping Losses.</strong> Besides the normal loss, mask loss and color loss are also adopted for optimizing geometry and appearance. However, it is inevitable that there exist some inaccuracies in the masks and color images, which will accumulate in the optimization and thus cause noisy surfaces and holes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ke83xzl.png\" alt=\"Figure 7. Ablation studies on different cross-domain diffusion schemes.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\ntrategy named outlier-dropping loss. Taking the color loss calculation as an example, instead of simply summing up the color errors of all sampled rays at each iteration, we first sort these errors in a descending order and then discard the top largest errors according to a predefined percentage. This approach is motivated by the fact that erroneous predictions lack sufficient consistency with other views, making them less amenable to effective minimization during optimization, and they often result in large errors. By implementing this strategy, the optimized geometry can eliminate incorrect isolated geometries and distorted textures.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15008\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Xiaoxiao Long, The University of Hong Kong, VAST, MPI Informatik and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(2) Yuan-Chen Guo, Tsinghua University, VAST and Equal Contributions;</p>\n<p>(3) Cheng Lin, The University of Hong Kong with Corresponding authors;</p>\n<p>(4) Yuan Liu, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(5) Zhiyang Dou, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(6) Lingjie Liu, University of Pennsylvania;</p>\n<p>(7) Yuexin Ma, Shanghai Tech University;</p>\n<p>(8) Song-Hai Zhang, The University of Hong Kong;</p>\n<p>(9) Marc Habermann, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(10) Christian Theobalt, MPI Informatik;</p>\n<p>(11) Wenping Wang, Texas A&amp;M University with Corresponding authors.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

From a report: The department said it was seeking public comments by March 4 on potential rules to safeguard the supply chain for drones, saying threats from China and Russia \"may offer our adversaries the ability to remotely access and manipulate these devices, exposing sensitive U.S. data.\" \n\nChina accounts for the vast majority of U.S. commercial drone sales. In September, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the department could impose restrictions similar to those that would effectively ban Chinese vehicles from the United States and the focus will be on drones with Chinese and Russian equipment, chips and software. She told Reuters in November she hopes to finalize the rules on Chinese vehicles by Jan. 20. A decision to write new rules restricting or banning Chinese drones will be made by the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who takes over on Jan. 20.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=US+Considers+Potential+Rules+To+Restrict+or+Bar+Chinese+Drones%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F1642245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F1642245%2Fus-considers-potential-rules-to-restrict-or-bar-chinese-drones%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/1642245/us-considers-potential-rules-to-restrict-or-bar-chinese-drones?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567225&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We present a strong regression-based model for zero-shot shape reconstruction. The core of our model is an intermediate representation of the 3D visible surface which facilitates effective explicit 3D geometric reasoning. We also curate a large real-world evaluation benchmark to test zeroshot shape reconstruction methods. Our benchmark pools data from three different real-world 3D datasets and has an order of magnitude larger scale than the test sets used by prior work. Tested on our benchmark, our model significantly outperforms other SOTA methods and achieves higher computational efficiency, despite being trained with much less 3D data. We hope our effort is a meaningful step towards building zero-shot generalizable 3D reconstruction models.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Acknowledgement</strong>.

Limitations and Discussion</h2>\n<p>Due to computational resource limitations, we are not able to process and train our model on the full Objaverse dataset. Currently, the meshes from Objaverse we use only consist of 5% of Objaverse and 0.4% of Objaverse-XL objects. Based on the promising scaling properties of recent foundation models [12, 24, 61], we believe it will be valuable to explore the scaling properties of method.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnother limitation of our work is that we have not considered the modeling of object texture. Predicting textures of unseen surfaces is highly ill-posed and can greatly benefit from a strong 2D prior. Given the recent success of 2D diffusion models [48] and their application in optimization-based 3D generation methods [7, 11, 29, 34, 40, 59], we think it will be promising to initialize or regularize these methods with our shape prior, potentially boosting both the optimization efficiency and generation quality.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14198\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zixuan Huang, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and both authors contributed equally to this work;</p>\n<p>(2) Stefan Stojanov, Georgia Institute of Technology and both authors contributed equally to this work;</p>\n<p>(3) Anh Thai, Georgia Institute of Technology;</p>\n<p>(4) Varun Jampani, Stability AI;</p>\n<p>(5) James M.

Qualitative Results</h2>\n<p>We show qualitative results of different methods in Fig. 5. Generative approaches such as Point-E and Shap-E tend to have sharper surfaces and contain more details in their generation. However, many details are erroneous hallucination that do not accurately follow the input image, and the visible surfaces are often reconstructed incorrectly. Previous regression-based approaches such as MCC better follow the input cues in the input images, but the hallucination of the occluded surfaces is often inaccurate. </p>\n<p>\\\nWe observe that One2-3-45, OpenLRM and SS3D cannot always accurately capture details and concavities. Comparing with prior arts, the reconstruction of ZeroShape not only faithfully capture the global shape structure, but also accurately follows the local geometry cues from the input image. More qualitative results are included in the supplement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"55ablationstudy\">5.5. Ablation Study</h2>\n<p>We analyze our method by ablating the design choices we made. We consider baselines by modifying different modules correspondingly. The results are shown in Tab. 4.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Explicit geometric reasoning.</strong> We first consider the baseline without any geometric reasoning (Ours w/o geo). We remove the projection unit together with the depth and camera pretraining losses. The number of parameters is controlled to be the same, and we train the model for the same number of total iterations. Comparing the first row to the last row, we see that enforcing explicit geometric reasoning in our model positively affects performance.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Alternative intermediate representations.</strong> Prior works [56, 64, 65] typically consider depth as the 2.5D intermediate representation. To compare this to our projection-based representation, we consider a baseline where the latent vectors directly come from the depth map instead of a 3D projection map. As shown in Tab. 4 (Ours w/o unproj), depth leads to inferior performance to our intrinsic-guided projection map representation.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Intrinsic-guided projection.</strong> We propose joint learning of intrinsics with depth to more accurately estimate the 3D</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ed830wg.png\" alt=\"Figure 6. Benefits of intrinsics learning. We show the reconstructed visible surfaces for two real image inputs. The visible surface is unprojected from estimated depths, with either fixed intrinsics or predicted intrinsics. Using fixed intrinsics cause unrealistic deformations in the 3D aspect ratio of the visible object surface (e.g. objects appear to be compressed).\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nshape of the visible object surface. To study the impact of this, we compare our full model with a baseline without intrinsics learning, where the unprojection to 3D is done via a fixed intrinsics during both training and testing. This baseline (Ours w/o intr) leads to indifferent performance to using depth intermediate representation and is worse than our full model. We also show qualitative examples of the estimated surface using our pretrained intrinsics estimator in Fig. 6. Compared with fixed intrinsics, unprojection with our estimated intrinisics leads to more accurate reconstruction of the visible surface.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14198\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Zixuan Huang, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and both authors contributed equally to this work;</p>\n<p>(2) Stefan Stojanov, Georgia Institute of Technology and both authors contributed equally to this work;</p>\n<p>(3) Anh Thai, Georgia Institute of Technology;</p>\n<p>(4) Varun Jampani, Stability AI;</p>\n<p>(5) James M.

      "content": "Abstract of a paper [PDF] published on National Bureau of Economic Research: Fertility levels have greatly decreased in virtually every nation in the world, but the timing of the decline has differed even among developed countries. In Europe, Asia, and North America, total fertility rates of some nations dipped below the magic replacement figure of 2.1 as early as the 1970s. But in other nations, fertility rates remained substantial until the 1990s but plummeted subsequently. \n\nThis paper addresses why some countries in Europe and Asia with moderate fertility levels in 1980s, have become the \"lowest-low\" nations today (total fertility rates of less than 1.3), whereas those that decreased earlier have not. Also addressed is why the crossover point for the two groups of nations was around the 1980s and 1990s. An important factor that distinguishes the two groups is their economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. Countries with \"lowest low\" fertility rates today experienced rapid growth in GNP per capita after a long period of stagnation or decline. They were catapulted into modernity, but the beliefs, values, and traditions of their citizens changed more slowly. Thus, swift economic change may lead to both generational and gendered conflicts that result in a rapid decrease in the total fertility rate.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Babies+and+the+Macroeconomy%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F1432246%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F1432246%2Fbabies-and-the-macroeconomy%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/1432246/babies-and-the-macroeconomy?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567127&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Department leaders first learned of the problem around 8 p.m., when deputies at several sheriff's stations began having trouble logging onto their patrol car computers, officials told The Times in a statement. \n\nThe department said it eventually determined its computer-aided dispatch program -- known as CAD -- was \"not allowing personnel to log on with the new year, making the CAD inoperable.\" It's not clear how long it will take to fix the problem, but in the meantime deputies and dispatchers are handling everything old-school -- using their radios instead of patrol car computers. \n\n\"It's our own little Y2K,\" a deputy who was working Wednesday morning told The Times. The deputy, along with three other department sources who spoke to The Times about the problem, asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record and feared retaliation.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=LA+County+Sheriff's+Computer+Dispatch+System+Crashes+on+New+Year's+Eve%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F1335216%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F1335216%2Fla-county-sheriffs-computer-dispatch-system-crashes-on-new-years-eve%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/1335216/la-county-sheriffs-computer-dispatch-system-crashes-on-new-years-eve?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23567087&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>Nowadays, we are generating terabytes of data every second, AI is writing our emails, and yet some companies use data infrastructure which needs to be in a museum. The moment siloed systems, clunky legacy software, and manual processes begin choking the life out of innovation and efficiency — you are trying to win a Formula 1 race with a horse and buggy. If this sounds painfully too familiar, you are not alone. In this article, we'll cut through the hype and show you precisely how to realistically modernize your data infrastructure. We'll get into key steps and introduce you to <a href=\"https://skyvia.com/?utm_source=media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hackernoon\">Skyvia</a> — the most comprehensive data integration platform that makes this process surprisingly simple.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisdatainfrastructuremodernization\"><strong>What Is Data Infrastructure Modernization?</strong></h2>\n<p>Data infrastructure modernization represents upgrading and changing an organization's data systems, architecture, and practices to fit the demands of modern business operations. That often has to do with overcoming the limitations of the systems of yore holding back agility and innovation today. We refer to those monolithic databases, siloed data lakes, and brittle ETL processes that struggle to keep up with the volume, velocity, and variety of modern data.</p>\n<p>\\\nModernization isn't about buzzing words chasing each other. It's to make the enterprise have a very strong, scalable, secure foundation for data-driven decision-making. It could be in the form of:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Migration to the cloud</strong>: Gain scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility with cloud-native services.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopting a microservices architecture</strong>: It is about the development of big monolithic systems into smaller, more manageable components.</li>\n<li><strong>Implementing robust data governance</strong>: Ensures the quality of data, secures data, and complies with regulations such as GDPR for data privacy or HIPAA for healthcare data protection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"modernizingyourdatainfrastructureinsteps\"><strong>Modernizing Your Data Infrastructure in Steps</strong></h2>\n<p>Modernizing your data infrastructure requires a practical approach that ties directly to business goals and delivers measurable results.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat follows is a very practical, step-by-step means of navigating this transformation effectively:</p>\n<h4 id=\"1setclearobjectivesandgoals\"><strong>1. Set Clear Objectives and Goals</strong></h4>\n<p>Define the specific outcomes your organization aims to achieve through modernization. These objectives will serve as the foundation for your strategy and keep all stakeholders aligned.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is eliminating data silos the way to get more collaboration?</li>\n<li>Are you in need of real-time analytics to make quicker decisions?</li>\n<li>Is the objective to enhance operational efficiency through automation?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nTranslate these objectives into measurable targets to ensure accountability. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve data accuracy by 20% within six months.</li>\n<li>Automate 50% of manual data handling tasks within the next quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"2assessyourexistinginfrastructureforshortcoming\"><strong>2. Assess Your Existing Infrastructure for Shortcoming</strong></h4>\n<p>A comprehensive review of your current systems, tools, and workflows is necessary to help you understand where your infrastructure has failed. This should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mapping all data sources, methods of storage, and integration points.</li>\n<li>Identifying inefficiencies that include duplicated processes, outdated systems, or siloed data.</li>\n<li>Assessing data quality, completeness, and governance practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nApply this assessment to shed light on key areas for enhancement and focus efforts for the biggest impact moving forward with business operations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3rankinitiativesbyroi\"><strong>3. Rank Initiatives by ROI</strong></h4>\n<p>Not all modernization efforts are created equal, and it is critical to ensure that resources are focused on areas that will yield the highest value. To this end:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation Cost: How much up-front will be needed for the project?</li>\n<li>Difficulty and Timeline: Is it going to be realistic to deliver it within the given amount of time?</li>\n<li>Expected Benefits: Will it reduce costs, improve decision-making, or drive revenue growth?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nFocus on short-term wins that meet immediate pain points but set up the prerequisite foundation for bigger, longer-term projects. For example, automating repetitive tasks like data imports can save time right away. Once streamlined, these processes make it easier to introduce more advanced solutions like predictive analytics.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4utilizescalabletools\"><strong>4. Utilize Scalable Tools</strong></h4>\n<p>The tools you adopt will determine the success and scalability of the modernization effort. A modernized ecosystem typically requires tools in these categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Integration Platforms: Tools that connect, transform, and synchronize data across systems.</li>\n<li>Cloud Platforms: Services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to provide scalable and cost-efficient infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Data Storage Solutions: Modern databases and data warehouses such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Amazon Redshift.</li>\n<li>Automation Platforms: Tools to automate data workflows, eliminate manual processes, and improve efficiency.</li>\n<li>Data Governance Tools: Solutions to ensure data security, compliance, and quality management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nChoosing the right tools depends on your organization’s needs and scalability goals. For example, cloud-based platforms offer flexibility, while integration tools connect all your systems for a unified data environment.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Why Skyvia?</strong></p>\n<p>Skyvia is one such tool designed to simplify data integration and modernization of your data infrastructure. As a no-code cloud platform, it offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An extensive library of 200+ connectors to unify data ecosystems effortlessly.</li>\n<li>Real-time integration capabilities to keep systems synchronized without delays.</li>\n<li>Powerful automation features to streamline repetitive workflows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nWith Skyvia, you can manage complex data operations without extensive technical expertise, making it a practical choice for businesses looking to modernize quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h4 id=\"5implementandmonitorsuccessusingkeymetrics\"><strong>5. Implement and Monitor Success Using Key Metrics</strong></h4>\n<p>Once implemented, track the performance of your data infrastructure using key metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Processing Speed: Measure how quickly your systems process data.</li>\n<li>Set up KPIs: Data processing speed, error rates, and system uptime could all be tracked to assess performance.</li>\n<li>Regular Reviews: Periodically assess to ensure that objectives are being achieved and revise the strategy if necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nModernization is iterative. As your business evolves, so should your data infrastructure evolve with changing demands.</p>\n<p>\\\nYour data infrastructure should be flexible and scalable to grow alongside your business while adapting to future changes. Whether scaling up to meet increasing demands or optimizing for cost-efficiency, a well-designed system ensures you stay competitive and ready for tomorrow's opportunities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theroleofskyviainmoderndatainfrastructure\"><strong>The Role of Skyvia in Modern Data Infrastructure</strong></h2>\n<p>Modernizing data infrastructure requires tools that deliver both power and simplicity.

      "content": "<p>When I started building my derivatives exchange, Biqutex, I went through almost every marketing idea I could think of: Early Birds programs, Mystery Boxes, multi-level loyalty schemes, trading competitions, quizzes, paid ads in Telegram channels — you name it. At one point, I spent about $20K on a CPA banner campaign to promote a quiz-bonus event, even though we didn’t have a working testnet. Unsurprisingly, we mostly got a bunch of bounty hunters from Indonesia, who signed up for the bonuses, not the product.</p>\n<p>\\\nLooking back, I’m glad we ran those tests before the launch instead of after. Building an exchange isn’t easy, and if we’d started promoting a product at the MVP stage, we would’ve spent years refining something that ultimately needed a complete pivot. Instead, those early failures saved us time. I ended up scrapping 90% of the pages and plans from our original product documents and rethinking our approach. That $20K might feel like a lot, but it was much cheaper than years of chasing the wrong vision.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat I’m sharing here are the lessons we learned along the way. Hopefully, this can save another team from making the same mistakes. And, maybe even keep them from spending that extra $20K.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosingarealisticallyservablemarket\"><strong>Choosing a realistically servable market</strong></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/YgtC57GeE2g16prziG7AJ8fNWti1-791343q.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAt some point, I realized that trying to compete with the big exchanges — especially by targeting the top 100 coins — wouldn’t work. It’s an incredibly competitive market. With platforms like Binance and Bybit dominating thanks to their massive user bases, liquidity, and resources. Breaking into that space felt completely unrealistic for us.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, we shifted focus to a less crowded part of the market. Instead of trying to be an all-encompassing exchange, we decided to position Biqutex as a derivatives launchpad for early-stage tokens — whose founders want to launch a derivatives market for their token but don’t meet the requirements for sufficient trading volumes or the high listing costs of tier 1 exchanges. It’s a smaller, more specific niche, but one where we felt we could actually deliver value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testingearlywithtrustedusers\"><strong>Testing early with trusted users</strong></h3>\n<p>\\\nWhen you’re building something as complex as a crypto exchange, starting with trusted users is critical. For us, those early testers were friends, colleagues, and traders we already knew from the community. In short, people who understood the space and were willing to give us honest feedback.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe stakes are too high to launch a platform like this to thousands of users right out of the gate. Even in production, things can go wrong, and dealing with issues at scale can be a nightmare. Starting small gave us the chance to test the waters without taking on too much risk.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you’re building a product in a niche, chances are it’s not your first time in that space. You’ve probably crossed paths with people who fit your ideal customer profile (ICP). If not, finding them early is crucial. Your mom or partner might cheer you on, but they’re not your market. The people around you who align with your product’s vision are the ones to trust with early testing.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat’s great about testing with your circle is that they’re likely willing to help out of personal loyalty. But the real win is when they stick with your product because it actually fits their needs — not just because they know you. That’s your first step toward achieving product-market fit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingacommunitywithhealthymotivation\">Building a Community with Healthy Motivation</h3>\n<p>Starting an exchange means starting from zero — no users, no fees, no trades. Motivating early users to engage with your platform is critical, but it’s also tricky. Misaligned incentives, like giving rewards for meaningless actions, can attract bounty hunters who sign up only for bonuses and leave as soon as they can cash out. Similarly, allocating large amounts of tokens to VCs at early stages often leads to token dumps that hurt long-term value. Finding the right way to align incentives with meaningful participation is key.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne of the best examples of growing a community from scratch using tokens was demonstrated<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyperliquid-hype-token-surges-after-billion-dollar-airdrop\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyperliquid-hype-token-surges-after-billion-dollar-airdrop\">by HyperLiquid</a></strong>, a derivative DEX, through its highly effective HYPE token airdrop. The airdrop became the largest in history, with the peak value of the distributed tokens estimated at ~$10.8 billion.&nbsp; As part of their launch strategy, Hyperliquid allocated 31% of their total token supply — 310 million tokens — directly to their community during a genesis airdrop event. The token distribution was thoughtfully structured to prioritize long-term engagement and community growth:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>31%</strong> allocated to the genesis airdrop, distributed to early users based on meaningful engagement.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>38.888%</strong> reserved for future emissions and community rewards to ensure ongoing participation incentives.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>23.8%</strong> designated for current and future contributors, supporting platform development and maintenance.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>6%</strong> set aside for the Hyper Foundation to guide the project’s strategic growth.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>0.3%</strong> allocated for community grants to encourage innovation and ecosystem expansion.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>0.012%</strong> reserved for HIP-2, a specific community-driven initiative.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The airdrop wasn’t just a giveaway. It was designed to recognize and reward real contributions. Eligibility depended on meaningful activities like trading volume and providing liquidity, ensuring the tokens went to users who were genuinely engaged with the platform. This approach encouraged active participation, attracted loyal users, and built a strong foundation for community growth.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheir airdrop has since become a benchmark for effectively using token distribution to foster a sustainable, community-driven project.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor our project, we didn’t issue tokens. We relied on a bonus system to reward engagement. While the specifics differ, the principle remains the same: incentives should drive real value, not just fleeting interest. It’s not about giving rewards; it’s about using them to build a lasting connection with the right users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingthoughtleadershiptobuildtrust\"><strong>Using Thought Leadership to Build Trust</strong></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/YgtC57GeE2g16prziG7AJ8fNWti1-x1334x7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nCrypto is known for its anonymity. But at the same time, it relies heavily on trust to onboard users, which isn’t easy to build. Trust comes from two things: <strong>who</strong> is behind the project and <strong>what</strong> they’re doing. If you’re a well-known founder, this process is easier. But for most, trust must be earned by clearly understanding what you’re building and showing that you can handle the risks in such a sensitive space.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn my case, I addressed the security aspect by using a custodian to manage user assets. This allowed me to assure users that my exchange doesn’t have access to their funds — only the established custodian does. For DeFi projects, this might involve auditing smart contracts to prove their reliability.</p>\n<p>\\\nDespite these safeguards, many projects launch with faceless teams and rely on generic communication, which feels distant and impersonal. That approach doesn’t work when building something like a centralized exchange, where trust is critical.</p>\n<p>\\\nI wasn’t naturally inclined to put myself out there. My Twitter wasn’t active, and I wasn’t used to talking about my work publicly. However I realized early on that sharing my journey as a founder could help build trust in ways that traditional marketing couldn’t. Whether joining podcasts, writing about our progress on Twitter, or answering questions directly, showing up as the face of Biqutex helped users connect with the project.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt’s not just about being visible; it’s about being transparent. Talking openly about what’s working and what’s not, and our decisions makes users confident that we’re not hiding anything. It’s a simple way to stand out in an industry where so many projects keep their teams hidden behind pseudonyms or corporate branding.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildinglongtermpartnershipswithinfluencers\"><strong>Building Long-Term Partnerships with Influencers</strong></h3>\n<p>Crypto traders spend a lot of time on platforms like YouTube and Twitter, making these platforms ideal for connecting with potential users. What worked for us wasn’t one-off shoutouts or generic ads but creators who focused on producing high-quality, authentic content. Even smaller creators made a big impact when they showcased the platform in-depth, walking their audience through how it worked or providing tutorials. Educational content, like explaining trading strategies or features unique to the platform, proved far more compelling than a simple 30-second mention.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a space where skepticism is high, quality content — especially educational material — does more than just drive traffic. It helps potential users understand the value of your platform and builds trust through transparency and depth. Influencers delivering content that resonates with their audience creates a stronger, more lasting connection to your product.</p>\n<p>\\n Banner ads, CPA campaigns, and overly generous incentives didn’t work because they brought in the wrong users — people chasing bonuses, not the product. We couldn’t retain them. The real shift came when we focused on a niche we understood deeply, had direct access to the target users, and could offer real value to them. Testing with these early adopters helped refine the product. Thought leadership and personal branding from the team built trust; community engagement ensured retention, and influencer partnerships brought in quality traffic. Though this approach might seem like baby steps, it’s precisely what’s needed to attract the right early users and ensure the product is solid before scaling further.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The chambers of Tonga's Parliament recently witnessed a defining moment in the nation's political narrative, one that speaks volumes about the delicate dance between personal ambition and national unity. At the heart of this story stands Dr. Viliami Latu, whose campaign for Prime Minister became a testament to the complexities of political timing and the true meaning of leadership.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe pivotal moment arrived with Lord Nuku's speech, which cast a telling shadow across the parliamentary floor. The atmosphere in the chamber shifted palpably as both nobles and people's representatives revealed their allegiances through subtle nods and knowing glances. It was a moment that demanded political acumen and selfless wisdom - a chance for Dr. Latu to demonstrate the very unity he championed in his campaign speeches.</p>\n<p>\\\nYet, as the political winds blew decisively against his favor, Dr. Latu and his team, led by the former Prime Minister Sovaleni, chose to press forward. Their persistence, while perhaps born of conviction, transformed what could have been a moment of graceful unity into a protracted political struggle. They marshaled their resources and time, wielding statistics about their administration's economic achievements like shields against the inevitable.</p>\n<p>\\\nTheir claim of reducing inflation from 10.9% to 0.9% echoed through the chambers, but these numbers rang hollow when measured against the International Monetary Fund's sobering report. The 2024 Article IV Consultation painted a different picture with its 4.6% inflation rate, undermining not just their economic narrative but the credibility of their broader campaign.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn Tongan politics, as in life, timing and grace often matter more than persistence. A withdrawal following Lord Nuku's speech could have written a different story - one of a leader who chose the path of unity over the pursuit of power. Such a decision would have resonated through Tonga's political memory, marking Dr. Latu not as a defeated candidate but as a statesman who understood that sometimes leadership means stepping aside.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe true essence of political leadership in Tonga transcends the mere holding of office. It lies in understanding the subtle rhythms of power, the unspoken signals of support and opposition, and most importantly, in knowing when the pursuit of position must yield to the greater cause of national harmony. This episode in Tonga's political history serves not as a tale of victory or defeat, but as a reflection on the nature of leadership itself - a reminder that in the grand tapestry of governance, the threads of unity often weave a stronger pattern than those of ambition.</p>\n<p>\\\nMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate the House for the nomination of Dr. 'Aisake Eke as the new Prime Minister. The nation's future is in good hands, and I look forward to watching them shape a brighter future for all Tongans.</p>\n<p>\\\nMerry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year!</p>",

Alternatively, Design Patterns are common approaches to common problems which have been formalized and are generally considered a good practice. Antipatterns are the opposite and are&nbsp;<em>undesirable</em>.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Chatty Input / Output (I/O) Anti pattern occurs when the cumulative effect of a large number of Input and Output requests has a significant negative impact on the performance and responsiveness of a service. Network calls and other I/O operations are inherently slow compared to compute tasks. Each I/O request typically has significant overhead, and the cumulative effect of numerous I/O operations can slow down the service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"potentialsources\">Potential Sources</h2>\n<p>Application components that can be the source of chatty I/O include:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Databases:</em></strong>&nbsp;Can become chatty when a single use case or business transaction results in multiple queries to the same set of data.</li>\n<li><strong><em>APIs:</em></strong>&nbsp;Requiring multiple network calls for a single user operation will slow down an application as each call contains data overhead (i.e. sender information, headers, authentication).</li>\n<li><strong><em>File Operations:</em></strong>&nbsp;An application that continually reads and writes small amounts of information to a file will generate significant I/O overhead. Small write requests can also lead to file fragmentation, slowing subsequent I/O operations still further.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"examplesofchattyio\">Examples of Chatty I/O</h2>\n<p>The following examples demonstrate the Antipattern.</p>\n<h3 id=\"readingandwritingindividualrecordstoadatabaseasdistinctrequests\">Reading and writing individual records to a database as distinct requests</h3>\n<p>The following example reads from a database of products. There are three tables, Product, ProductSubcategory, and ProductPriceListHistory. The code retrieves all of the products in a subcategory, along with the pricing information, by executing a series of queries:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Query the subcategory from the ProductSubcategory table.</li>\n<li>Find all products in that subcategory by querying the Product table.</li>\n<li>For each product, query the pricing data from the ProductListPriceHistory table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThe application uses Entity Framework, a layer of software that enables developers to work with data using objects without focusing on the underlying database where this data is stored.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-cp034ti.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"then1problem\">The N+1 Problem</h2>\n<p>The example above shows the problem explicitly, but sometimes an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) can mask the problem, if it implicitly fetches child records one at a time. This is known as the \"N+1 problem\".</p>\n<p>\\\nThe N+1 query problem happens when the data access framework executed N additional SQL statements to fetch the same data that could have been retrieved when executing the primary SQL query. The larger the value of N, the more queries will be executed and the larger the performance impact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementingasinglelogicaloperationasaseriesofhttprequests\">Implementing a single logical operation as a series of HTTP requests</h3>\n<p>This often happens when developers try to follow an object-oriented paradigm and treat remote objects as if they were local objects in memory. This can result in too many network round trips. For example, the following web API exposes the individual properties of User objects through individual HTTP GET methods.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-5v134q4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>While there's nothing technically wrong with this approach, most clients will probably need to get several properties for each User, resulting in client code like the following.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-vv035dt.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"readingandwritingtoafileondisk\">Reading and writing to a file on disk</h2>\n<p>File I/O involves opening a file and moving to the appropriate point before reading or writing data. When the operation is complete, the file might be closed to save operating system resources. An application that continually reads and writes small amounts of information to a file will generate significant I/O overhead. Small write requests can also lead to file fragmentation, slowing subsequent I/O operations still further.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe following example uses a FileStream to write a Customer object to a file. Creating the FileStream opens the file, and disposing it closes the file. (The using statement automatically disposes the FileStream object.) If the application calls this method repeatedly as new customers are added, the I/O overhead can accumulate quickly.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-nq135w4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofixtheproblem\">How to Fix the Problem</h2>\n<p>Some of the remedies for fixing this Antipattern include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fetch data from a database as a single query, instead of several smaller queries.</li>\n<li>Follow REST design principles for web APIs.</li>\n<li>Buffer data in memory for file operations and then write data once</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"databasefetchdatainasinglequery\">Database: Fetch Data in a Single Query</h3>\n<p>Fetch data from a database as a single query, instead of several smaller queries.

Here's a revised version of the web API from the earlier example. Instead of separate GET methods for each property, there is a single GET method that returns the User. This results in a larger response body per request, but each client is likely to make fewer API calls.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-j7534ko.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"filebufferdatainmemory\">File: Buffer Data in Memory</h2>\n<p>For file I/O, consider buffering data in memory and then writing the buffered data to a file as a single operation. This approach reduces the overhead from repeatedly opening and closing the file and helps to reduce fragmentation of the file on disk.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-sf6349m.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"servicegranularity\">Service Granularity</h2>\n<p>The Service Granularity Principle is a software design concern that specifies the scope of business functionality and the structure of the message payload in a service operation. Achieving optimal service granularity can be difficult. Too granular and the service can become chatty while too course can be inefficient by retrieving more data than is required.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Use Case for the service must be matched with the proper service granularity to ensure an efficient design which avoids the Chatty IO AntiPattern.</p>\n<h2 id=\"detectingtheproblem\">Detecting the Problem</h2>\n<p>Symptoms of chatty I/O include high latency and low throughput. End users are likely to report extended response times or failures caused by services timing out, due to increased contention for I/O resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"processmonitoring\">Process Monitoring</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Perform process monitoring of the production system to identify operations with poor response times.</li>\n<li>Perform load testing of each operation identified in the previous step.</li>\n<li>During the load tests, gather telemetry data about the data access requests made by each operation.</li>\n<li>Gather detailed statistics for each request sent to a data store.</li>\n<li>Profile the application in the test environment to detect possible, I/O bottlenecks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"lookforanyofthesesymptoms\">Look for any of these symptoms:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>large number of small I/O requests made to the same file.</li>\n<li>large number of small network requests made by an application instance to the same service.</li>\n<li>large number of small requests made by an application instance to the same data store.</li>\n<li>Applications and services becoming I/O bound.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"monitortheapplicationusingappdynamics\">Monitor the Application Using App Dynamics</h3>\n<p>Using an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) package such as App Dynamics to capture and analyze key metrics that can identify chatty I/O.

For example, database, file or API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Chatty I/O is an Anti pattern that can occur within several parts of an application or service including the database, file operations and inter-process communications with APIs. The cumulative effect of a large number of I/O requests can have a significant impact on performance and responsiveness. Several monitoring techniques can be used to find the root cause of the chatty component. Software designs should consider the Service Granularity Principle. That is, scoping data retrieval to match the Use Case so the appropriate amount of data is retrieved in each request.</p>\n<p>\\\nThanks &amp; Happy reading!</p>",

These subjects include Prealgebra (Prealg), Algebra, Number Theory (N.Theory), Counting and Probability (C.Prob), Geometry, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus (Precalc), with problems categorized from levels ”1” to ”5” based on difficulty. Following the setting of Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2023b), we evaluated four typical problem types (C.Prob, N.Theory, Prealg, Precalc), excluding level-5 geometry problems from the test set.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>ML-Benchmark</strong></p>\n<p>\\\n Given the absence of datasets and evaluation metrics for assessing capabilities in the machine learning domain, we developed a benchmark dataset and corresponding evaluation method known as ML-Benchmark. This dataset encompassed eight representative machine learning tasks categorized into three difficulty levels, ranging from easy (level 1) to most complex (level 3). Each task was accompanied by data, a concise description, standard user requirements, suggested steps, and metrics (see Table 8 in the Appendix). For tasks labeled as “toy”, the data was not divided into training and test splits, which required the framework to perform data splitting during modeling.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Open-ended task benchmark</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nTo evaluate the ability to generalize to real-world tasks, we developed the Open-ended task benchmark, comprising 20 tasks. Each task required the framework to understand user needs, break down complex tasks, and execute code. They delineated their requirements, foundational data or sources, steps for completion, and specific metrics. The scope was broad, encompassing common needs like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), web search and crawling (WSC), automated email replies (ER), web page imitation (WPI), text-to-image conversion (T2I), image-to-HTML code generation (I2C), image background removal (IBR), and mini-game generation (MGG). We showcase about these tasks in Figure 13, Figure 15, and Figure 16 in the Appendix.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>4.1.2 EVALUATION METRICS</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nIn the MATH benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021), accuracy served as the chosen evaluation metric, aligning with the setting proposed in (Wu et al., 2023b; Hendrycks et al., 2021). Considering the variability in interpreting test results, we manually reviewed the outputs generated by all methods to determine the count of accurate responses. For the ML-Benchmark, three evaluation metrics were utilized: completion rate (CR), normalized performance score (NPS), and comprehensive score (CS). These metrics provided comprehensive insights into the model’s performance and were defined as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-9r830uz.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-8z930x4.png\" alt=\"Table 1: Performance comparisons on ML-Benchmark. “WR”, “BCW”, “ICR”, “SCTP”, and “SVPC” represent “Wine recognition”, “Breast cancer wisconsin”, “ICR - Identifying age-related conditions”, “Santander customer transaction prediction”, and “Santander value prediction challenge”, respectively.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>Normalized performance score (NPS): I</em></strong>n our ML-Benchmark, each task was associated with its evaluation metric, which may vary between tasks, including metrics such as accuracy, F1, AUC and RMSLE, etc. For metrics such as accuracy, F1, and AUC, we presented the raw values to facilitate comparison across identical data tasks.

To ensure a fair comparison with other frameworks, we kept our experience pool empty to eliminate any prior knowledge. The effect of experience learning is reported in Table 3. MATH dataset: We adopted zero-shot baselines, including MathChat (Wu et al., 2023b) and AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023a) with GPT-4-Turbo as the baseline for a fair comparison. We set N=3 for ACV in the MATH dataset. Considering the variability in interpreting test results, we manually reviewed the outputs generated by all methods to determine the count of accurate responses (Wu et al., 2023b). ML-Benchmark: We selected four typical open-source LLM-based agent frameworks that support data analysis and modeling as baselines: XAgent (Team, 2023), AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023a), OpenInterpreter (Lucas, 2023), and TaskWeaver (Qiao et al., 2023). By default, we set N = 1 for ACV in ML-Benchmark and conducted the experiments before January 2024 for all baseline frameworks. Open-ended task benchmark: We employed AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023a) and OpenInterpreter (Lucas, 2023) as baseline models. Each framework underwent three experiments per task, and we reported the average completion rate. We also set N = 1 for ACV in the open-ended task benchmark by default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"42mainresult\">4.2 MAIN RESULT</h2>\n<p><strong>Performance on math problem solving</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nAs illustrated in the Figure 7, the Data Interpreter achieved the best results across all tested categories, reaching 0.81 accuracy in the N.Theory category, which was a 0.15 improvement over AutoGen. In the most challenging category, Precalc, the Data Interpreter obtained an accuracy of 0.28, an increase of 0.16 compared to AutoGen. Notably, the inclusion of ACV resulted in significant improvements across all task categories, with an average improvement of 17.29% relative improvement compared to the version without ACV. On average, the ACV strategy showed 26% relative improvement compared to AutoGen.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-q7830av.png\" alt=\"Figure 7: Performance on the MATH dataset.

It was the only framework with a comprehensive score exceeding 0.9 on Titanic, House Prices, SCTP, and ICR. The Data Interpreter outperformed other frameworks and gained a significant advantage on corresponding datasets, showing a notable improvement of 24.7% and 21.2% over AutoGen in ICR and SVPC, respectively. The Data Interpreter completed all mandatory processes on every dataset and consistently maintained superior performance, more details can be found in Table 5 in the Appendix.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Performance on open-ended tasks</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nTable 2 illustrates that the Data Interpreter achieved a completion rate of 0.97, marking a substantial 112% improvement compared to AutoGen. For the IBR task, all three frameworks achieved a 1.0 completion score. In OCR-related tasks, the Data Interpreter achieved an average completion rate of 0.85, outperforming AutoGen and OpenInterpreter by 26.8% and 70.0%, respectively. In tasks requiring multiple steps and utilizing multimodal tools/interfaces, such as WPI, I2C, and T2I, the Data Interpreter emerged as the sole method to execute all steps. AutoGen and OpenInterpreter failed to log in and obtain the status for the ER task, resulting in a lower completion rate. The Data Interpreter can dynamically adjust the task and achieve a 0.98 score in completion rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"43ablationstudy\">4.3 ABLATION STUDY</h2>\n<p><strong>Ablation on core modules</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nTo assess the performance of various modules, we conducted ablation experiments with three additional configurations on the ML-Benchmark. The initial setup entailed the ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) framework with simplified prompt phrases that allow code execution. The second configuration integrated dynamic planning, encompassing hierarchical planning and dynamic plan management following each step to facilitate real-time adjustments. The third configuration incorporated the utilization and generation functionalities of tools, which defaulted to the Data Interpreter.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-58830p6.png\" alt=\"Table 3: Ablation on core modules.

It helped prepare the dataset and track changes to the data in real-time, resulting in better performance, especially in terms of completion rate. Furthermore, using tools resulted in an additional improvement of 9.84%, bringing the comprehensive score to 0.94.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Ablation on LLM backbones</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nIn machine learning tasks, more extensive LLM backbones such as Qwen-72B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023) and Mixtral-8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024) exhibited performance comparable to GPT-3.5-Turbo, while smaller LLMs experienced performance degradation.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs shown in Figure 8, our Data Interpreter, when paired with smaller models such as Yi-34BChat (01-ai, 2023), Qwen-14B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), Llama2-13B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), and even DeepSeek-7B-Chat (Bi et al., 2024), effectively handled tasks such as data loading and analysis. However, these models faced limitations when executing tasks requiring advanced coding proficiency, which can lead to incomplete processes. In open-ended tasks, Mixtral-8x7B achieved high completion rates in three tasks but encountered challenges in the WSC task due to difficulty accurately outputting complete results to CSV files. Similar to machine learning tasks, smaller LLMs encountered execution failures due to their restricted coding abilities while acquiring images or parsing webpage results. (See Figure 8).</p>\n<p>\\\nAblation on experience learning To evaluate experience learning, we conducted experiments on five tasks with varying experience pool sizes, measuring task efficiency by debugging attempts and cost. Increasing the pool size from 0 to 200 significantly reduced debugging attempts from 1.48 to 0.32 per task, with costs decreasing from $0.80 to $0.24. This highlights substantial efficiency gains from experience learning. Notably, at a pool size of 80, debugging attempts decreased, especially in ER, Titanic, and House Prices tasks, by 1.25, 1, and 1, respectively.

More information can be found in Section 3.1. Then, Data Interpreter completes tasks by breaking them down as outlined in the plan and executing code, with tools incorporated as necessary to augment proficiency. Detailed explanations are provided in Section 3.2. Moreover, each task is subjected to a validation process to ensure its reliability. The process of executing a task is then characterized and analyzed as an experience, which can be retrieved for similar tasks in the future. More information on this mechanism is provided in Section 3.3.</p>\n<h3 id=\"31dynamicplanningwithhierarchicalstructure\">3.1 DYNAMIC PLANNING WITH HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE</h3>\n<p>The intensive data dependence complicates modeling and orchestrating data science pipelines. In this section, we outline these pipelines naturally organized by the graph, modeling them with the hierarchical structure, and introduce dynamic plan management for effective orchestration.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>3.1.1 HIERARCHICAL GRAPH FOR DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nData science projects encompass extensive detailing and long-range pipelines, complicating the direct planning of all detailed tasks and coding. This complexity necessitates careful planning, execution, and management (Biswas et al., 2022). Drawing inspiration from the application of hierarchical planning in automated machine learning tasks (Mohr et al., 2018; Mubarak &amp; Koeshidayatullah, 2023), we organize the data science pipelines via hierarchical structure, which initially decomposes</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ab83091.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: The overall design of Data Interpreter. This framework consists of three stages: dynamic plan graph and management, wherein a plan is generated for data science problems, and the state of each task is managed during execution; tool utilization and evolution, involving the selection or creation of suitable tools to solve problems, continually evolving these tools; and automated confidence-based verification, which examines and votes on logically sound solutions.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nthe intricate data science problem into manageable tasks and further break down each task into specific actions executed through code (in Figure 3(a)).</p>\n<p>\\\nFigure 3(b) illustrates the hierarchical data science task pipelines composed of data exploration, correlation analysis, outlier detection, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and result visualization tasks (green region in Figure 3 (b)). Alongside the task graph, code as an implicit graph represents the corresponding execution actions of the code generated by LLMs (the purple region in Figure 3 (b)). This hierarchical graph structure facilitates structured problem-solving for our Data Interpreter and adeptly captures both sequential task relationships (such as from model training to model evaluation and visualization) and parallel task relationships (such as outliers detection and correlation analysis). Therefore, we propose structuring data science workflows as a hierarchical directed acyclic graph (DAG), aptly representing data science pipelines at both task and coding levels. Our Data Interpreter leverages the advanced planning capabilities of LLMs to decompose the complex data science problem into multiple tasks consistent with the problem goal and express their executing dependencies through a graph structure. We design the metadata for each task node, including task description, completion status, and code. Appendix B.2 describes more details about the task node.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ep930wg.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: Hierarchical structure. (a) A structured task and action graph illustrating the workflow in a high-level machine learning project, depicting task dependencies and action sequences required for fulfilling project objectives. (b) Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks. Machine operational status prediction problem as an example. The task graph is an expression of the disassembled planned tasks. The action graph also referred to as the execution graph, executes the node based on the planned task graph. The execution code of each node is converted by LLM.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>3.1.2 DYNAMIC PLAN MANAGEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nLeveraging a hierarchical graph structure, tasks are executed automatically. Unlike previous methods (Wei et al., 2022; Besta et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022) that create and execute plans once before execution for static problems, we investigate that in intensive data dependence scenario, the intermediate data among tasks will be dynamically changed during execution due to tool operations or new information in the workflow, which can lead to runtime errors if the data does not match the pre-defined plan. To tackle this, we introduce a dynamic plan management, detailed in Figure 4.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo ensure efficient progress execution and facilitate plan modifications, our Data Interpreter dynamically updates the corresponding code, execution result, and status of each node in the task graph following each execution. A task is considered completed by successfully executing the corresponding code. Once completed, the task is marked as “Success” and added to a completed tasks list, proceeding to the next task according to the plan. On the contrary, the task is marked as “Failure” if it fails.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe have designed two strategies: Self-debugging and Human editing, aimed at enhancing autonomous completeness and correctness. In the event of task failure, Self-debugging is enabled, utilizing LLMs to debug the code based on runtime errors, up to a predefined number of attempts. If the task remains unresolved, it is flagged as “Failure”. Due to the high logic requirements of data science problems, an additional human-in-the-loop approach, human editing, is introduced to ensure code precision. When Human editing is activated, our Data Interpreter holds the task until it is manually modified, upon which it is rerun based on human input.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-1qb30wu.png\" alt=\"Figure 4: Dynamic Plan management of Data Interpreter. (a) Plan refinement using human editing. The left image illustrates a human-edited task on the graph, and the refined plan with updated tasks 3.1’, 3.2’, along with newly added task 3.3, is delineated in the right image. (b) Plan refinement for the failed task. After task execution, Task 3.3 fails. The refined plan integrates existing success tasks, replaces task 3.3 with the updated task 3.3’, and introduces new tasks 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 5.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe Data Interpreter will regenerate the plan for failed or manually edited tasks based on current episodic memory and the context of execution. Specifically, the regenerated task graph is sorted in topological order and then compared to the original task graph using a prefix matching algorithm (Waldvogel, 2000) to identify any differences in instructions. Based on this comparison, the fork can be identified. The final output of this process includes all unchanged tasks existing before the fork and any new tasks added or modified after the fork.</p>\n<p>\\\nThroughout execution, our Data Interpreter monitors the dynamic task graph, promptly removing failed tasks, generating refined tasks, and updating the graph. This avoids the inefficiency of generating fine-grained planning tasks at once and improves the success rate of plans requiring multi-step execution, making it better suited for scenarios where the data flow constantly changes in data science problems.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"32toolutilizationandgeneration\">3.2 TOOL UTILIZATION AND GENERATION</h2>\n<p>To address the intricate nature of tasks that are too complex to be entirely coded from scratch, utilizing existing toolkits or integrating existing code snippets becomes essential. Take, for example, feature engineering, which demands domain-specific expertise for data transformation. In such cases, using tools crafted by experts can be significantly more effective, as generating this type of code directly through LLMs poses considerable challenges. Similarly, email processing involves orchestrating different code snippets to establish efficient workflows. To improve the efficiency of using these tools, we suggest a two-pronged method: one focuses on recommending or generating the most suitable tools, while the other organizes these tools effectively. This approach offers clear advantages over previous methods (Schick et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2023), which relied on mere library calls or did not incorporate tools using clear modularization in the code. By combining the strengths and mitigating the weaknesses of these methods, our approach presents a more balanced and efficient solution. Notice that tool usages follow the principles and procedures of the task graph described in Section 3.1.1; the use of tools itself would be considered one of the tasks in the graph.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-tn830jq.png\" alt=\"Figure 5: Tool usage pipeline in Data Interpreter. The tool recommendation initially selects tools based on task classification. Then the tool organization combines multiple tools as needed to accomplish tasks.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n<strong>3.2.1 TOOL RECOMMENDATION AND ORGANIZATION</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nIn tool recommendations, the Data Interpreter classifies tools based on task descriptions and types. This process effectively narrows down the pool of potential tools, making the selection process more efficient for subsequent tasks. It then identifies the top-k tools that best fit the tasks by evaluating the compatibilities of the candidate tools with one task. Additionally, we incorporate a tool schema to help LLMs understand these tools’ functionalities and use cases, embedding this schema during execution phases as outlined in Appendix B.3.1. This schema-guided understanding enables more accurate tool selection and application. Besides, during execution, the algorithm dynamically adjusts tool parameters using LLMs, considering the code context and task requirements. This dynamic parameter adjustment improves tool adaptability to the tasks at hand.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn tool organizations, our method employs LLMs to seamlessly integrate tools into the code, optimally positioning them based on a thorough analysis of the tool functions. This is particularly useful for complex tasks such as feature engineering, facilitating a process that is efficient and adaptable to the integration of tools. We refine this process by considering the context of the current task and the tools at our disposal. The LLM is directed to craft code that not only invokes the required tool functions but also seamlessly integrates these calls with other aspects of the code. This allows for dynamic orchestration of various tools tailored to the specific requirements of the encoding process. A prime example of this adaptability is demonstrated with the CatCount tool in our deployment pipeline (Figure 5), showcasing the dynamic use of its fit and transform functions according to the task context. This strategy ensures that tool integration is automated and precisely aligned with task demands, significantly boosting coding efficiency and flexibility.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>3.2.2 CONTINUOUS TOOL EVOLUTION</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nTo minimize the frequency of debugging and improve execution efficiency, our model learns from experience during task execution. After each task, it abstracts tools by distilling their core functionalities, stripping away any sample-specific logic. This creates versatile, generic tool functions that are added to the library for future use.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn addition, the Data Interpreter automatically ensures the reliability of these tools by conducting rigorous unit tests and leveraging its self-debugging capabilities through LLMs. Consequently, Data Interpreter facilitates rapidly transforming sample-specific code snippets into reusable tool functions, continuously improving its toolkit and coding expertise over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"33enhancingreasoningwithverificationandexperience\">3.3 ENHANCING REASONING WITH VERIFICATION AND EXPERIENCE</h2>\n<p>Our designed task graph, dynamic plan management, and tool utilization can improve task planning and tool mastery. However, relying only on error detection or capturing exceptions is inadequate feedback to complete a task. For complex reasoning problems, even if the code runs without raising errors, it can still contain logical flaws (Wang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a).Therefore, in this section, we introduce automated confidence-based verification and leverage experience further to improve the correctness and efficiency of the reasoning results.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>3.3.1 AUTOMATED CONFIDENCE-BASED VERIFICATION</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nTo address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective technique, Automated Confidence-based Verification (ACV) , which introduces an interpretation layer between the environment and the Data Interpreter. This approach allows LLMs to evaluate code execution results and determine if the code solution is mathematically rigorous or logically correct. Specifically, once a code solution for the task starts to be executed, the Data Interpreter is required to generate a validation code to ensure that the output result complies with the task requirement. The validation code is designed to simulate the logical process according to the task description and to verify the correctness of the result generated by the code. This process is similar to performing white-box testing on each task, guaranteeing that the code produces the expected output.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ag830ne.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\nThe confidence score helps the Data Interpreter choose a more accurate result as the final answer by ranking the average confidence scores corresponding to different execution results.</p>\n<p>\\\nA specific example of this automated confidence-based verification process from the MATH dataset is shown in Figure 6. The validation code takes into account both the task, the code, and its execution result. The function is prime is to check the code, the probability is generated from the task description, and given answer is the candidate answer. In this example, the process undergoes five separate verifications. Specifically, the results of the code execution (that is, the candidate response) for the first and fifth validations are 1/108. For the remaining verifications, the results consistently are 56/219. The candidate answer (i.e. 1/108) gets two confidence scores (0.2 and 1), with an average of 0.6. Another candidate answer (i.e. 56/219) gets three confidence scores (0.2, 0.5, and 0.2), with an average of 0.3. As the former gets a higher average confidence score, our Data Interpreter selects 1/108 as the final answer, and it is correct. In contrast, simply using the majority voting strategy will choose the latter, which is wrong.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-dh930ah.png\" alt=\"Figure 6: Example for Automated Confidence-based Verification. Inside the dotted box is the verification process, and below the dotted box is the final answer based on verification.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\n<strong>3.3.2 EXPERIENCE-DRIVEN REASONING</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nAs the automated confidence-based verification makes the task-solving process more transparent and reliable, the data generated in the verification can be reused as experience for other tasks. Therefore, we improve the Data Interpreter’s adaptability through a reflective analysis that allows tasks to be reviewed, updated, and confirmed. This process is called Experience-Driven Reasoning.</p>\n<p>\\\nSpecifically, the Data Interpreter integrates an external repository designated as the ’experience pool’ to archive essential elements of each task, including task description, final version code, and final answer. In the pool, all archived data is reorganized into reusable experiences based on the reflective mechanism (Zhao et al., 2023; Shin et al., 2023). These experiences, including both failed and successful attempts can provide a comprehensive context for a task.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis pool functions as a valuable resource, enabling the retrieval of past experiences to inform and optimize new task executions. An experience can be reused if it is found to be one of the nearest neighbors of a new task from the vector store, which is generated through task-level reflective analysis. Specifically, for a certain task, top-k experiences are retrieved as the context of the current task, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of its reasoning. This approach mirrors the fundamental principles of human cognition, where individuals take advantage of past experiences to enhance decision-making and problem-solving.

Details of Datasets</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2relatedwork\">2 RELATED WORK</h2>\n<p><strong>LLMs as data scientist agents</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nCutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on diverse natural and programming data, exhibit strong interpretation abilities. Like, (Gao et al., 2023) (Chen et al., 2022) leverages program interpreters to decouple complex computation, (Zhou et al., 2023a) boost their performance on the MATH dataset, and (Hendrycks et al., 2021), (Li et al., 2023), (Liang et al., 2023) enable code-based reasoning capabilities in embodied agents. CodeAct (Wang et al., 2024) executes and dynamically revises code actions through multi-turn interactions with a Python interpreter. Building on code interpretation capabilities, researchers are exploring ways to leverage LLMs to address data science challenges(Bordt et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024; Hassan et al., 2023; Sanger et al., 2023) and integrate LLMs with specialized machine learning ¨ pipelines. For instance, (Huang et al., 2023) develops or enhances Machine Learning models from data and task descriptions autonomously. In addition, (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023) pairs LLMs with systematic evaluation to discover solutions to open problems by evolving executable programs describing solution methods. However, there is a lack of datasets and evaluation methods designed to assess the abilities of LLM-based methods in this field. We benchmark our work and various opensource frameworks on machine learning problem-solving to provide more insight and understanding of this research area.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Planning</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nPlanning is the critical capability of LLM-based agents. Planning capability emphasizes the generation of logically structured actions or thoughts roadmap for specific problems (Huang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a). For the planning capability of LLM-based agents, earlier work such as CoT (Wei et al., 2022) and ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) focus on the decomposition of complicated tasks and perform sequential planning for subtasks. Due to the complexity of tasks, one single plan generated by the LLM-based agent is sometimes infeasible. Hence, some kinds of work, such as ToT (Yao et al., 2024) and GoT (Besta et al., 2023), are designed to generate multiple plans and select one plan to execute. Although these previous planning approaches demonstrate impressive performance, they struggle to address multi-step problems with strong task dependencies, a common occurrence in data science tasks. Alternatively, we utilize dynamic hierarchical planning to enhance the capability, allowing for the decomposition of complex problems into task and action graphs, commonly encountered in data science scenarios.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Tools</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nRecent research has focused on improving the capabilities of LLMs by creating and integrating external tools (Schick et al., 2024; Paranjape et al., 2023). (Zhuge et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024) propose multiple agents to solve multimodal tasks. (Yuan et al., 2023) introduce a general tool creation and retrieval framework for LLMs with a plug-and-play approach. (Liu et al., 2023) proposed an automatic tool selection mechanism based on LLM decision-making rather than statically assigning specific tools for certain tasks. In the field of self-creation of tools, (Cai et al., 2023) transformed the role of LLM from a tool user to a creator, achieving self-sufficiency in tool creation. (Qian et al., 2023) presented a framework that combines the creation and use of tools to solve problems. In this paper, we have expanded the types and range of tools usage. We not only implemented the two types of tools proposed in their future work, named “Upgrade of Existing Tool” and “Combination of Multiple Tools”, but also improved tool generation efficiency and practicality. We achieve this by leveraging execution experience instead of relying on Few-Shot Prompts. Furthermore, this study supports creating various private tool libraries and allows LLMs to independently select and combine multiple tools as needed.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Reasoning</strong> </p>\n<p>\\\nReasoning capability emphasizes understanding and processing of information to make decisions (Huang et al., 2024), which is another key strength of LLM-based agents. For the reasoning capability, previous works such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024), Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2024), CRITIC (Gou et al., 2023) focus on encouraging LLM-based agents to reflect on failures and refine the reasoning process. Moreover, (Gao et al., 2023) is pioneering work in leveraging code to improve the accuracy of LLM to solve mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning problems. (Chen et al., 2022) decouples complex computation from language understanding and reasoning by using a program interpreter to solve numeric reasoning tasks. (Wang et al., 2023) leverages an iterative prompting mechanism to enhance programs used as actions by agents in Minecraft based on feedback from the environment and self-verification. Unlike prior approaches that primarily focused on general language feedback or execution feedback, our work tackles the unique challenges posed by data science problems that require advanced logical reasoning. Specifically, we propose novel automated confidence-based verification mechanisms to improve reasoning capability.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18679\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

However, their performance can be compromised in data science scenarios that require real-time data adjustment, expertise in optimization due to complex dependencies among various tasks, and the ability to identify logical errors for precise reasoning. In this study, we introduce the Data Interpreter, a solution designed to solve with code that emphasizes three pivotal techniques to augment problem-solving in data science: 1) dynamic planning with hierarchical graph structures for real-time data adaptability; 2) tool integration dynamically to enhance code proficiency during execution, enriching the requisite expertise; 3) logical inconsistency identification in feedback, and efficiency enhancement through experience recording. We evaluate the Data Interpreter on various data science and real-world tasks. Compared to open-source baselines, it demonstrated superior performance, exhibiting significant improvements in machine learning tasks, increasing from 0.86 to 0.95.

The solution will be released at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1introduction\">1 INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agents to excel in a wide range of applications, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness (Guo et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2023b). These LLM-powered agents have significantly influenced areas like software engineering (Hong et al., 2023), navigating complex open-world scenarios (Wang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a), facilitating collaborative multi-agent structures for multimodal tasks (Zhuge et al., 2023), improving the responsiveness of virtual assistants (Lu et al., 2023), optimizing group intelligence (Zhuge et al., 2024), and contributing to scientific research (Tang et al., 2024).</p>\n<p>\\\nRecent studies focused on improving the problem-solving capabilities of these agents by improving their reasoning process, aiming for increased sophistication and efficiency (Zhang et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023; Sel et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2022). However, data-centric scientific problems, including machine learning, data analysis, and mathematical problem-solving, present unique challenges that remain to be addressed. The machine learning process involves complex, lengthy task handling steps, characterized by intricate dependencies among multiple tasks. This requires expert intervention for process optimization and dynamic adjustment in the event of failure or data updates. It is often challenging for LLMs to provide the correct solution in a single attempt. Furthermore, these problems demand precise reasoning, and thorough data verification (RomeraParedes et al., 2023), which poses additional challenges to the LLM-based agent framework.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-y683vp9.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: Comparison with various open-source frameworks on machine learning tasks and real-world open-ended tasks.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nMoreover, existing works such as (Qiao et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Lucas, 2023) address datacentric problems through code-based problem-solving methods, known as the interpreter paradigm, which combines static requirement decomposition with code execution. However, several key challenges arise when employing these frameworks in practical data science tasks: <strong><em>1) Data dependence intensity:</em></strong> The complexity inherent in data science arises from the intricate interplay among various steps, which are subject to real-time changes (Liu et al., 2021). For accurate results, data cleaning and comprehensive feature engineering are prerequisites before developing any machine learning model. Therefore, it is critical to monitor data changes and dynamically adjust to the transformed data and variables. The machine learning modeling process, encompassing feature selection, model training, and evaluation, involves a broad spectrum of processing operators and search spaces (Zheng et al., 2021). The challenge lies in generating and resolving the entire process code simultaneously. <strong><em>2) Refined domain knowledge:</em></strong> The specialized knowledge and coding practices of data scientists are pivotal in addressing data-related challenges. Typically embedded in proprietary code and data, this knowledge often remains inaccessible to current LLMs. For instance, generating code for data transformation in specific domains such as energy or geology may pose a challenge for LLMs without the requisite domain expertise. Existing methodologies predominantly depend on LLMs, a reliance that may streamline the process but potentially compromise performance. <strong><em>3) Rigorous logic requirements:</em></strong> Currently, interpreters such as (Qiao et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Lucas, 2023) incorporate code execution and error capturing capabilities to enhance problem-solving performance. However, they often neglect error-free execution, erroneously considering it as correct. While basic programming tasks can be streamlined and depend on immediate execution feedback when requirements are delineated, data science problems often pose ambiguous, irregular, and not well-defined requirements, making it difficult for LLMs to understand. Consequently, LLM-generated code solutions for task resolution may contain ambiguities that necessitate rigorous validation of logical soundness, extending beyond mere execution feedback.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce an LLM-based agent, called the Data Interpreter, designed specifically for the field of data science. This agent follows a plan-code-verify approach to fulfill human requirements by breaking down tasks, executing code, and verifying feedback. Specifically, we propose <strong><em>1) Dynamic planning with hierarchical structure:</em></strong> Our Data Interpreter employs hierarchical graph structures to comprehend the inherent complexities of data science more effectively. A dynamic planning approach equips it with the adaptability to task variations, proving especially efficient in monitoring data changes and managing intricate variable dependencies inherent in data science problems. <strong><em>2) Tool utilization and generation:</em></strong> We enhance coding proficiency by integrating various human-authored code snippets, and creating custom tools for specific tasks beyond mere API-focused capabilities. This process involves the automatic combination of diverse tools with self-generated code. It utilizes task-level execution to independently build and expand its tool library, simplify tool usage, and perform code restructuring as needed. <strong><em>3) Enhancing reasoning with logic bug aware:</em></strong> This is based on the confidence score derived from execution results and test-driven validations, which are essential for an exception-free scenario. It detects inconsistencies between the code solution and test code execution and compares multiple trials to reduce logic errors. Throughout the execution and reasoning process, task-level experiences, primarily comprising metadata and runtime trajectory, which include both successes and failures, are recorded.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs depicted in Figure 1, our Data Interpreter significantly surpasses existing open-source frameworks. Compared to these baselines, the Data Interpreter exhibits superior performance, with 10.3% (from 0.86 to 0.95) improvement in machine learning tasks and 26% enhancement on the MATH dataset, demonstrating robust problem-solving capabilities. In open-ended tasks, its performance has more than doubled, marking a 112% increase, showcasing its efficacy in tackling a wide spectrum of challenges.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n• We propose a dynamic planning framework with hierarchical structures, enhancing adaptability and problem-solving capabilities in data science tasks.</p>\n<p>\\\n• We improve the proficiency and efficiency of coding in LLMs by introducing automated tool integration for tool utilization and generation.</p>\n<p>\\\n• We improve reasoning by integrating verification and experience, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of problem-solving.</p>\n<p>\\\n• Our experiments demonstrate that our Data Interpreter exceeds existing benchmarks in machine learning tasks, mathematical problems, and open-ended tasks, thus setting a new standard for performance.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18679\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

It is an important species for regional fisheries, but their transportation and migration patterns during early life stages remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the stable oxygen isotope ratios of otoliths of young-of-the-year (age 0) Japanese sardines collected from the northern offshore and southern coastal areas of the Sea of Japan in 2015 and 2016. The ontogenetic shifts of the geographic distribution were estimated by comparing the profiles of life-long isotope ratios and temporally varying isoscape, which was calculated using the temperature and salinity fields produced by an ocean data assimilation model. Individuals that were collected in the northern and southern areas hatched and stayed in the southern areas (west offshore of Kyushu) until late June, and thereafter, they can be distinguished into two groups: one that migrated northward at shallow layer and one that stayed around the southern area in the deep layer. A comparison of somatic growth trajectories of the two groups, which was reconstructed based on otolith microstructure analysis, suggested that individuals that migrated northward had significantly larger body lengths in late June than those that stayed in the southern area. These results indicate that young-of-the-year Japanese sardines that hatched in the southern area may have been forced to choose one of two strategies to avoid extremely high water temperatures within seasonal and geographical limits. These include migrating northward or moving to deeper layers. Our results indicate that the environmental variabilities in the southern area could critically impact sardine population dynamics in the Sea of Japan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1introduction\">1 Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Japanese sardine (<em>Sardinops melanostictus</em>) is a species with large biomass fluctuations. The abundance of Japanese sardines showed substantial fluctuations of several orders of magnitude during the last 3000 years (Kuwae et al., 2017), and fluctuations have also been reported regarding the associated fisheries catch in recent centuries (Yasuda et al., 2019). These fluctuations are considered to be driven by environmental variabilities, which are often represented by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (e.g., Chavez et al., 2003). Clarification of the mechanistic links between climate and marine environments and population fluctuation is necessary for the accurate prediction of resource abundance and fisheries management. Variations in survival rates during the post-hatching larval and juvenile stages are hypothesized to be of great importance for population fluctuations (e.g., Hjort, 1914). Therefore, the knowledge of the geographical distributions and environment of Japanese sardines during its critical life stages are essential for revealing the impact of climate and marine environment changes on population fluctuations.</p>\n<p>\\\nCurrent fisheries management of the Japanese sardine assumes two management units or stocks— the Pacific stock (distributed in the western North Pacific) and the Tsushima Warm Current Stock (distributed in the Sea of Japan), both of which show large fluctuations in abundance at similar time scales. While the patterns of transport and migration during the early life stages have been reported for the Pacific stock (e.g., Okunishi et al., 2009; Sakamoto et al., 2019), such knowledge for the Tsushima Warm Current Stock is insufficient. Spawning of the Tsushima Warm Current Stock occurs in coastal areas from west Kyushu to the Noto Peninsula from winter to early summer (January–June, Fig. 1). The main spawning ground changes depending on the sea surface temperature and spawning stock biomass (Furuichi et al., 2020). The young-of-the-year Japanese sardine is widely found from the off Noto Peninsula to the west coast of Kyushu in late summer (Ito, 1961; Yasuda et al., 2021). A recent study showed that the environment of the northern offshore area of the Sea of Japan with larger and lipid-rich prey zooplankton is suitable for the energy acquisition of sardine juveniles (Yasuda et al., 2021). In addition, the distribution of the stock is known to expand and shrink in response to population fluctuations; during periods of increased biomass, the distribution of the stock area expands to the northern offshore area of the Sea of Japan (Muko et al., 2018). These observations lead to the hypothesis that the successive and successful transportation (or migration) of juveniles to the northern offshore area might be the driver of the increase in stock (Muko et al., 2018; Yasuda et al., 2021). However, the origin, transportation, and migration routes of the individuals that reach the northern offshore area of the Sea of Japan have not yet been clarified. Understanding the movement patterns and their variety, and mechanisms that create the variety may, therefore, provide insights into energy acquisition strategies, population dynamics, and ultimately management of sardines in the region.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-4h830z6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"2materialsmethods\">2 Materials &amp; Methods</h2>\n<h3 id=\"21fishsamplingandotolith18oanalysis\">2.1 Fish sampling and Otolith δ 18 O analysis</h3>\n<p>The young-of-the-years of Japanese sardines were collected for otolith analyses in three sampling areas (off Noto Peninsula, Tsushima Strait, and off Goto Islands) in the Sea of Japan from August to September in 2015 and 2016 by the R/V Yoko-maru, Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency (Fig. 1; Table 1). Fish were frozen immediately after capture and preserved in -80 or -20 °C. Thereafter, the specimens were thawed in a laboratory on land and their scaled body length (BL) and body weight were measured. Sagittal otoliths were extracted, cleaned using a brush, rinsed with ethanol and distilled water, and dried at room temperature for several hours. The dried otoliths were embedded in epoxy resin (p-resin, Nichika Inc.) on a glass slide, and then placed in a dryer at 40 °C for at least a day to fix the otoliths. Thereafter, the embedded otoliths were polished with sandpaper (No. 1000, 2000) until the otolith core was exposed from the epoxy resin, and then the entire otolith was polished with alumina suspension (BAIKOWSKI International Corporation) to ensure that the daily rings could be easily observed under a microscope. The number of daily rings of the otolith and otolith daily increment widths were measured using an otolith measurement system (RATOC System Engineering Co. Ltd.). The otoliths of 154 individuals from 18 stations were used for daily ring measurements (Table 1).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ny830i6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-3g9306y.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"23estimationofmigrationhistory\">2.3 Estimation of migration history</h3>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-hwa30tz.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTo validate the estimated results, the estimated distribution area on the date closest to the sampling date for each individual was compared with the actual sampling area. In addition, the estimated distribution area on the date closest to the hatch date was compared with the results of a monthly egg and larval survey conducted at prefectural fisheries field stations (Oozeki et al., 2007; Furuichi et al., 2020).</p>\n<h3 id=\"24statisticalanalysis\">2.4 Statistical analysis</h3>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-v6b30pb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>To examine the differences in biological characteristics between potentially different migratory types, namely the northward migration group (off Noto Peninsula individuals) and resident group (Tsushima Strait and off Goto Islands individuals; see Results and Discussion), we compared somatic growth trajectories between these groups. The Mann-Whitney U test for comparisons of hatching date and BL at the time of sampling was conducted between groups. We also compared the BL before sampling. BL before the time of sampling was calculated using the biological intercept method, assuming a linear relationship between the otolith radius and BL with fixed 5.9 mm of BL at the deposition of the first increment of the otolith, following Takahashi et al. (2008). To test for differences in the daily growth rates among the groups, anomalies of the 3-day running-mean otolith increment width normalized by standard deviation were compared among the three sampling areas using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The anomalies were calculated in two ways: for each day age of the fish and for each calendar day (days from January 1st each year). When a significant difference was detected, a post-hoc Steel-Dwass test was performed to identify areas with significant differences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3results\">3 Results</h2>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-eh830no.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-0893029.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-cya30lo.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"34comparisonofhatchingdatesblanddailygrowthratedifferences\">3.4 Comparison of hatching dates, BL and daily growth rate differences</h3>\n<p>There was a significant difference in the hatching dates between the northward migration group (63 ± 32 days from January 1st; mean ± 1SD) and the resident group (43 ± 30 days from January 1st) (Table 2, p &lt; 0.02, Mann-Whitney U test). The mean BL of the northward group was 136.7 ± 6.4 mm and that of the resident group was 118.9 ± 9.4 mm. The BL of the northward group was significantly larger than that of the resident group (Table 2, p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). In spring (March-May), the mean back-calculated BL of the resident group was larger than that of the northward migration group (Fig. 6). However, from June, the mean back-calculated BL of the northward migration group was higher than that of the resident group. The mean BL at July 1st, which roughly corresponds to the timing when migration patterns started to diverge, was significantly larger in the northward migration group (northward migration: 104.8 ± 14.4 mm, resident: 95.1 ± 14.8 mm, Mann-Whitney U test, p &lt; 0.01, Table 2). When compared by daily age, the normalized deviation of daily growth rate among the three sampling areas was significantly different during 56–147 (with exception for 69, 76-78, and 140) daily age (p &lt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). Between the off Noto Peninsula and off Goto Islands individuals, the post-hoc Steel-Dwass test showed that the normalized deviation of daily growth rate was significantly different during 56–103 (with exception for 69, 76-78, 89, and 97-98) daily age (Fig. 7, p &lt; 0.05). Between the off Noto Peninsula and Tsushima Strait individuals, the deviation was significantly different between 71––75, 79–86, 88–139, and 141–147 daily age (Fig. 7, p &lt; 0.05) , if the periods that showed significance more than 5 sequential days. When compared by calendar days, there was a significant difference among groups during 113–206 (with exception for 120, 152–157, 170 and 192–193) days from January 1st (late April to late July) (p &lt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). The post-hoc Steel-Dwass test results showed that the normalized deviation of daily growth rate of the Tsushima Strait and off Goto Islands individuals were significantly different from those of the off Noto Peninsula individuals during 114–118 days (late April) and 185–191 (early July) and 194–206 days (middle July to late July) (Fig. 7, p &lt; 0.05), respectively, if the periods that showed significance more than 5 sequential days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4discussion\">4 Discussion</h2>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-48830mm.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe northward migration and the resident groups showed significant differences in growth trajectories. The mean BL in spring (March-May) was larger in the resident group (Fig. 6). This was likely because the mean hatch date of the resident group was earlier than that of the northward migration group (Table 2). No difference in the growth rate was observed between the resident group and the northward migration group up to 50 days after hatching (Fig. 7). However, the northward migration group grew faster 50 days after hatching than the resident group, and they became larger in June, despite their smaller size in spring (March-May). This suggests that individuals that grow relatively well during late spring and early summer within the population migrated northward.</p>\n<p>\\\nA migration pattern that includes both migratory and resident individuals is called partial migration, which is observed in various animals, including fish (Chapman et al., 2011, 2012). There are three types of seasonal partial migration of fish species (Chapman et al., 2012). The first is non-breeding partial migration, in which migrants and residents breed sympatrically, but spend non-breeding seasons separately. The second type is partial breeding migration, in which migrants and residents share a nonbreeding habitat but breed separately. The third is skipped breeding partial migration, in which migrants and residents share a non-breeding habitat, and individuals migrate to breed, but not every year, leading to partial migration. In addition to the above three types of partial migration, a shorter spatio-temporal partial migration is identified: partial diel vertical migration, in which migrants move vertically during the day or night while residents remain at the same depth (more details see Chapman et al., 2012). In the family of Japanese sardine, Clupea harengus shows the characteristic of the breeding partial migrants—they share a common feeding ground but migrate to different areas to spawn in the North Sea (Ruzzante et al., 2006). The Celtic Sea populations of C. harengus migrate into the Irish Sea for spawning; these migrants grow more slowly than residents and are therefore recruited later to the adult population (Burke et al., 2008). It is often observed that the body sizes of migrants and residents differ in animals who undergo partial migration (e.g., Kerr et al., 2009). Various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the factors that contribute to size differences (Chapman et al., 2011). The traditional “body size” hypothesis states that a larger body size is advantageous for residents because of their high physiological tolerance to adverse winter conditions (Ketterson and Nolan, 1976). However, exceptions to this hypothesis include birds, in which partial migrations have been well studied. Larger individuals of the male great bustard Otis tarda have been shown to migrate during the hot summer months; this has been attributed to the low tolerance for higher temperatures of the larger individuals compared to the smaller ones (Alonso et al., 2009). Additionally, larger individuals of tropical kingbirds, which have high energy requirements, tend to migrate (Jahn et al., 2010). Within skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) tagged and released from the same location in the western North Pacific, higher percentages of larger (46 cm or larger) individuals were collected at higher latitudes than smaller (44 cm or smaller) individuals (Nihira, 1996). In addition, northwardmigrated skipjack tuna had higher energy consumption than those at lower latitudes (Aoki et al., 2017). These findings suggest that the higher energy requirements of larger individuals promote migration, even for fish species. Similarly, in the case of the Japanese sardine in the Sea of Japan, larger individuals might migrate to acquire more energy due to the increase in sea surface temperature around Kyushu.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe water temperatures at depths of 10 m and 30 m on the west offshore of Kyushu were almost the same from February to June (Fig. 8). After June, however, the increase in water temperature at 10 m depth accelerated, and there was a difference between the water temperature at the depths of 10 m and 30 m due to the development of stratification. Excessive higher temperatures result in higher energy dissipation and demand substantial energy intake by consumption (Rudstam, 1988; Ito et al., 2013). The Japanese sardine might have avoided this by selecting one of the following two strategies: horizontally migrating northward at shallower depths or having deeper habitat depths and staying in the same area. Individuals with better growth and larger body size would have higher energy demands (Noguchi et al., 1990). Meanwhile, the abundance of zooplankton in the western Sea of Japan gradually decreases from spring to summer (Hirakawa et al., 1995); and zooplankton abundance and energy content in the northern Sea of Japan are higher than those in the western Sea of Japan during the summer months (Yasuda et al., 2021). The Japanese sardine in the northern offshore area had larger sizes and higher lipid contents (Yasuda et al., 2021). The Japanese sardines that were able to successfully reach the northern offshore area were rewarded with a better prey field. Thus, larger individuals that required more food may have migrated northward to remain in the optimal water temperature range and seek places where food is abundant. As partial migration was accompanied by habitat depth differences, this case may be considered a combination of non-breeding partial migration and partial vertical migration with larger migrants.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-3h930jv.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIn conclusion, we revealed migrations in the early life stages of the young-of-the-year Japanese sardine in the Sea of Japan in 2015 and 2016. They all hatched and grew west offshore of Kyushu until late June, and may have chosen one of the two strategies to avoid high temperatures within seasonal and geographical limits: migrating northward or moving deeper. Relatively well-grown individuals in summer were more likely to migrate northward to better feeding grounds, thereby suggesting that the environmental conditions in spawning and nursery grounds west offshore of Kyushu may be important for total energy acquisition during the first year of life. In future, it will be necessary to elucidate the factors that control the growth of individuals west of Kyushu. In addition, further analysis of the population structure is necessary to examine the contribution of individuals from spawning grounds in the Sea of Japan to the Tsushima Warm Current Stock.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conflictofinterest\">Conflict of Interest</h2>\n<p>All the authors have no conflict of interest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authorcontributions\">Author Contributions</h3>\n<p>\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-wa830rm.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"funding\">Funding</h3>\n<p>This study was partly supported by grants from the Fisheries Agency of Japan, Kurita Water and Environment Foundation, and JSPS KAKENHI (16H02944, 18H04921, 19H04247, 21H04735, 21K18653, and 22H05030).</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h3>\n<p>This is a preprint to be submitted to a journal.

Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The hypothesis that the annual rate of growth in the US consumer price index is a function of the annual growth in the US broad money supply minus the annual growth in US real GDP minus the annual growth in US savings, over the time period 2001 to 2019, has been shown to be the case. However, an exact relationship required the use of a non-zero residual term. A mathematical statistical formulation of a hyperinflationary process has been provided and used to quantify the period of hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic from July 1922 until the end of November 1923. The main mathematical difference between inflation and hyperinflation is that the former is a process with a constant rate of increase, at a constant acceleration, whereas the latter is a process with a constant rate of acceleration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supplementarymaterials\">Supplementary materials</h3>\n<p>There is an Appendix providing the mathematical statistical characterization of a hyperinflationary process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>No financial support was received for any aspect of this research.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<p>[1] “Monetary inflation”.

Discussion</h2>\n<p>The consumer price inflation model described is intended to investigate the consumer price index (CPI), over a period of years and not over a period of months, in order to investigate the longer-term relationships involved. In contrast, the hyperinflation model described is intended to investigate the increase in nominal prices, over a period of months, because of the accelerating nature of the decline in the purchasing power of the fiat currency being studied. Unlike in the case of hyperinflation, under “ordinary” circumstances, the growth in price inflation has a velocity, but the acceleration can be ignored because it is approximately constant, i.e., price inflation increases at an approximate constant rate with time.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe hypothesis that the annual rate of growth in the US CPI is a function of the annual growth in the US broad money supply minus the annual growth in US real GDP minus the annual growth in US savings, over the time period 2001 to 2019, has been shown to be the case. However, an exact relationship required the use of a non-zero residual term, RES(t):</p>\n<p>\\\n𝑣𝐶𝑃𝐼(𝑡) = 𝑣𝐵𝑀𝑆(𝑡) − 𝑣𝐺𝐷𝑃(𝑡) − 𝑣𝑆𝐴𝑉(𝑡) − 𝑅𝐸𝑆(𝑡)</p>\n<p>\\\nThis may be the case for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<p>\\\n(1) The measure of savings used was the estimated average annual American household savings [11]. While, this might be expected to be technically challenging to calculate accurately, it only pertains to households. It might be expected that in addition to average annual American household savings, there should also exist annual American non-household savings. Therefore, a limitation of this paper is that American household savings were used as a measure of overall savings in the US economy.</p>\n<p>\\\n(2) There may be an additional factor that needed to be included in the model, other than savings.</p>\n<p>\\\nSavings were included in the model because savings can be used, if required / desired to purchase goods and/or services, or not, as the case might be, and as a result might be expected to influence the CPI. An alternative approach might be to use another broad measure of the money supply that excludes savings.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe model includes the terms, BMS and GDP. So also does the concept of the “velocity of money” [15], in which:</p>\n<p>\\\n\"𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑦\" = 𝐺𝐷𝑃/𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑦 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦</p>\n<p>\\\nThis equation can be rearranged as follow:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-yx830gs.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, for the concept of the “velocity of money” to be relevant to this paper, it would need to be expressed in terms of its constant rate of change with time, as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-9l930lf.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nShould the CPI model be valid (subject to the caveat discussed above in relation to savings) such that:</p>\n<p>\\\n𝑣𝐶𝑃𝐼(𝑡) = 𝑣𝐵𝑀𝑆(𝑡) − 𝑣𝐺𝐷𝑃(𝑡) − 𝑣𝑆𝐴𝑉(𝑡)</p>\n<p>\\\nthis would predict a few different economic scenarios:</p>\n<p>\\\n(1) When there is no (or very little) growth in GDP or savings (“stagflation scenario”):</p>\n<p>\\\n𝑣𝐶𝑃𝐼(𝑡) = 𝑣𝐵𝑀𝑆(𝑡)</p>\n<p>\\\n(2) When the growth in savings is sufficiently high, the growth in CPI could turn negative (“deflation scenario”).</p>\n<p>\\\n(3) When there is negative growth in GDP (“recession scenario”), the growth in CPI could be greater than the growth in BMS, should there be no “rebalancing” change in the growth of BMS.</p>\n<p>\\\nA mathematical statistical formulation of a hyperinflationary process has been provided and used to quantify the period of hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic from July 1922 until the end of November 1923. Why did this hyperinflationary happen and why was it allowed to occur by the Government and central bankers of the Weimar Republic?</p>\n<p>\\\nAs outlined in [14], following World War 1 and the Treaty of Versailles (which came into effect on January 10, 1920), the strategy that Germany used to pay war reparations was the mass printing of bank notes to buy foreign currency, which was then used to pay reparations, but which also caused inflation of the paper mark. After Germany failed to pay France an instalment of reparations on time in late 1922, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr valley, Germany's main industrial region, in January 1923. The German government's response was to order a policy of passive resistance in the Ruhr, akin to a general strike, to protest the occupation, while providing financial assistance to the striking workers by printing more and more banknotes, with the result that the paper mark became increasing worthless throughout 1923.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe mathematical statistical formulation of a hyperinflationary process could be extended beyond two sequential exponential expansions to include any arbitrary number (n) of sequential exponential expansions. However, while this may have theoretical interest, it is not a phenomenon that has yet occurred in real-world economics, to the knowledge of the author.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12980\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

From a report: The tally of VCs investing in US-headquartered companies dropped to 6,175 in 2024 -- meaning more than 2,000 have fallen dormant since a peak of 8,315 in 2021, according to data provider PitchBook. \n\nThe trend has concentrated power among a small group of mega-firms and has left smaller VCs in a fight for survival. It has also skewed the dynamics of the US venture market, enabling start-ups such as SpaceX, OpenAI, Databricks and Stripe to stay private for far longer, while thinning out funding options for smaller companies. \n\nMore than half of the $71bn raised by US VCs in 2024 was pulled in by just nine firms, according to PitchBook. General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz, Iconiq Growth and Thrive Capital raised more than $25bn in 2024.

For an exponential expansionary process, the methodology provides a rate-constant (λ) for the exponential growth of the process (G(t)) and the associated information entropy for the time series under investigation [5,7]. This can be expressed as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\nG(t) = exp(λ 𝑥 t)</p>\n<p>\\\nand,</p>\n<p>\\\nInfo Ent (G(t)) = λ 𝑥 t</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile information entropy has no units, at any given time, it is related to the average growth rate (𝑟), where:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-2x830xu.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nConsequently, the information entropy of an expansionary process can be considered to be related to the “velocity” of the growth of a time series of values [5,7]. Henceforth, in the interests of nomenclature brevity, the following nomenclature will be adopted:</p>\n<p>\\\nvG(t) = Info Ent (G(t))</p>\n<p>\\\nwhere, v relates to the “velocity” of growth of any given time series, G(t).</p>\n<p>\\\nThe hypothesis that this paper will investigate, for the US time series over the period 2001 to 2019, is:</p>\n<p>\\\n𝑣𝐶𝑃𝐼(𝑡) = 𝑣𝐵𝑀𝑆(𝑡) − 𝑣𝐺𝐷𝑃(𝑡) − 𝑣𝑆𝐴𝑉(𝑡)</p>\n<p>\\\nwhere CPI is the consumer price index, BMS is the broad money supply, and SAV are average savings.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12980\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

The objectives of this paper were to develop economic models to (1) predict the annual rate of growth in the US consumer price index (CPI), based on the annual growth in the US broad money supply (BMS), the annual growth in US real GDP, and the annual growth in US savings, over the time period 2001 to 2019; (2) investigate the means by which monetary and price inflation can develop into monetary and price hyperinflation.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe hypothesis that the annual rate of growth in the US CPI is a function of the annual growth in the US BMS minus the annual growth in US real GDP minus the annual growth in US savings, over the time period investigated, has been shown to be the case. However, an exact relationship required the use of a non-zero residual term. A mathematical statistical formulation of a hyperinflationary process has been provided and used to quantify the period of hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, from July 1922 until the end of November 1923.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1introduction\">1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>Monetary inflation is a sustained increase in the money supply of a country (or currency area) and it is likely to result in price inflation, which is usually just called \"inflation\", which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services [1]. The consumer price index (CPI) is a common measure of price inflation [2]. While there is general agreement among economists that there is a causal relationship between monetary inflation and price inflation, there is no general agreement on the exact relationship between the two [1]. Hyperinflation is rapidly rising price inflation, typically measuring more than 50% per month [3]. Broad money includes both notes and coins, but also other forms of money, which can easily be converted into cash. It is the most inclusive method of calculating a given country's money supply [4].</p>\n<p>\\\nThe objectives of this paper are to investigate:</p>\n<p>\\\n(1) the hypothesis that the annual rate of growth in the US consumer price index (CPI) is a function of the annual growth in the US broad money supply (BMS) minus the annual growth in US real GDP minus the annual growth in US savings, over the time period 2001 to 2019, with 2001 as the reference year (time = 0).</p>\n<p>\\\n(2) the means by which monetary and price inflation can develop into monetary and price hyperinflation.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12980\">available on arxiv</a> under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

In a study examining sedentary and exercising rats over eight weeks, scientists found comprehensive changes in every tissue examined, from fat cells to mitochondria, with exercise often reversing disease-related molecular changes. The findings explain how exercise reduces heart disease and cancer risks by 50%.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Exercise+May+Be+the+'Most+Potent+Medical+Intervention+Ever+Known'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F0453240%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F02%2F0453240%2Fexercise-may-be-the-most-potent-medical-intervention-ever-known%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/01/02/0453240/exercise-may-be-the-most-potent-medical-intervention-ever-known?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23566853&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
