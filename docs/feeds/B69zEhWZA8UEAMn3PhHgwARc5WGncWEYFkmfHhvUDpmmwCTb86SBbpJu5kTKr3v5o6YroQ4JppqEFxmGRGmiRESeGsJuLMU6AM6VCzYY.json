It provides a unified, multi-plane control plane for service meshes, allowing users to manage, test, and integrate different service mesh technologies in a consistent and user-friendly way.\n\nService meshes are becoming increasingly important in microservices architectures, providing capabilities like traffic management, security, observability, and resilience. However, managing and orchestrating these meshes across large-scale distributed systems can be complex. Join CNCF Ambassador, Ahmed Bebars as he explores how Meshery addresses this complexity.",

Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nDynamic Management of X509 Certificates Using Kubernetes Certificate Operator - Abhidnya Joshi & Senthil Ponnuswamy, Dell Technologies\n\nSecurity is non-negotiable area and Kubernetes based environments are no exception! Usage of x509 certificates is the key thing. Be it K8s deployments in private or public cloud, ensuring availability of \"right\" X509 certificate for a service is very important. If this service is getting connected from external (apps/clients which are outside of K8s cluster) clients, this is even more important! But what is really the \"right\" x509 certificate and how can we ensure that is always remains \"right\"? Can we make corrections dynamically? Can we also ensure easy propagation of certificates imported from outside the cluster? Propagation of Certificate revocation lists to ensure services can deny revoked certificates?\n\nThis talk helps describe the strategy K8s based products can use to dynamically generate, make correction and propagation of X509 certificates within K8s cluster using K8s operator design pattern and makes use of well-known CNCF projects such as cert-manager and trust-manager.",

This keynote is all about the real stories from teams who’ve been through the trenches of cloud native adoption. We’ll talk about those long nights spent debugging, the heart-stopping moments when production goes down, and the ongoing struggle to nail down seamless observability and cost-efficient scaling.\n\nOver the last decade, end users’ needs have evolved from simple container orchestration to juggling multi-cloud and edge environments. But guess what? The challenges are a natural part of growth, and we’re here to dive into them! We’ll share experiences from both fast-growing startups and large enterprises, uncovering the common pain points that we all face: simplifying deployments, boosting security, and making everything run smoother and faster.\n\nWith a focus on practical insights and solutions, we’ll explore what the future of cloud native can look like: a world where the tools are powerful, intuitive, and accessible, allowing end users -- whether in small teams or large organizations -- to innovate and scale with confidence. Join us to see how we can make cloud native not just a powerful toolkit but an accessible, user-friendly ecosystem for the next generation of builders and operators",

A Case Study of Service Mesh Adoption at Flipkart - I V Prasad Reddy, Software Architect & Purushotham Malipedda, Platform Engineering, Flipkart\n\nIstio based ServiceMesh offers a lot of features. However realisation of these features differ in their requirement for adoption levels. Adoption of Service Mesh for a single service, all services in a call graph, all services of the organisation unlocks different sets of features. At Flipkart, leading e-commerce service in India, with ~6K services and a scale of 15 Mil RPS, practical constraints, scale challenges and failures of attempts at traditional onboarding, pushed us to arrive at a ZERO touch, operator powered and phased onboarding model. This approach expedited our Public Cloud bursting, Disaster Recovery solutions and unlocked features like service graph, securing east-west traffic etc.. With the services already onboarded to mesh, they are able to leverage mesh features with minimal and incremental changes that increased the usage. In this talk we like to share our journey of adopting Service Mesh, challenges faced and how adoption progressed with the operator model",

Traditional methods using Dockerfiles require ML engineers to navigate complex Linux processes and maintain multiple Dockerfiles for different projects, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, security mandates for regular patching and updates adding further to the complexity. Join this talk to explore how Cloud Native Buildpacks can simplify and secure MLOps deployments. By automating the packaging of ML projects, including custom libraries and hardware specifications, Buildpacks enhance flexibility, maintainability and security. This approach reduces the operational burden on both developers and security teams, ensuring a more efficient and scalable MLOps deployment process",
