Its leader Sahra Wagenknecht stems from the far left, but now accuses her former allies of being obsessed with identity politics rather than the interests of the working class. Her party is running on a mix of policies with both left-wing and right-wing characteristics. \n\nIn this episode of Berlin Briefing, DW’s Richard Walker and Matthew Moore break down the party’s positions together with German historian Katja Hoyer. From the BSW’s opposition to NATO, climate policies, and sending weapons to Ukraine, to its call for a stronger welfare state and a revival of Germany’s traditional industries with energy from Russia – the team build up a picture of this taboo-busting party and end with predictions about its impact on the political landscape.\n_\nDW’s Matthew Moore: BSW profile with Sahra Wagenknecht interview\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKOhG4R0pq8\n\nDW’s Ben Knight: What is Germany's populist BSW party?\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/what-is-germanys-populist-bsw-party/a-69958619\n\nBooks by Katja Hoyer:\nhttps://www.katjahoyer.online/books\n\n0:00       Introduction\n1:27       Who is Sahra Wagenknecht?\n2:49       Charisma\n5:07       Communist roots\n7:00       Early successes\n9:00       Left or right?\n11:35     Anti-woke\n13:54     Anti-NATO\n16:20     Ukraine\n18:03     Welfare, rent caps\n20:45     COVID, climate\n22:58     Migration\n25:34     Left-wing conservatism\n26:40     Who’s voting BSW\n28:37     BSW vs. AfD\n31:10     Predictions\n34:57     Impact\n37:13     After Sahra?\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#BSW #Berlin #Germany",

The Elon Musk-led company sold 1.79 million vehicles last year, it said Thursday, which was slightly less than what it delivered in 2023 and also below analysts’ consensus estimate. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas writes that the miss reflects a “relatively aged product” and more competition. In the broader market, stocks were mixed at the end of a holiday-shortened and turbulent week. European stocks dropped, with miners sliding on concerns about Chinese demand. Stellantis fell as much as 3.8% as some EV models that had previously received US tax credits for electric vehicles were excluded under tougher rules.\n\nToday's guests: Laura Cooper, Nuveen\n--------\n\"The Pulse With Francine Lacqua\" is all about conversations with high profile guests in the beating heart of global business, economics, finance and politics.
