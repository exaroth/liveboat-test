      "content": "After a four-year hiatus, 2025 will see the return of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest. Started in 1984 (and inspired partly by a bug in the classic Bourne shell), it's \"the Internet's oldest contest,\" acording to their official social media account on Mastodon. \n\nThe contest enters its \"pending\" state today at 2024-12-29 23:58 UTC &mdash; meaning an opening date for submissions has been officially scheduled (for January 31st) as well as a closing date roughly eight weeks later on April 1st, 2025. That's according to the newly-released (proposed and tentative) rules and guidelines, listing contest goals like \"show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way\" and \"stress C compilers with unusual code.\" And the contest's home page adds an additional goal: \"to have fun with C!\" \n\nExcerpts from the official rules:\n\n\nRule 0 \nJust as C starts at 0, so the IOCCC starts at rule 0. :-) \n\nRule 1 \nYour submission must be a complete program.... \n\nRule 5 \nYour submission MUST not modify the content or filename of any part of your original submission including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile (that we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data files you submit.... \n\n\nRule 6 \nI am not a rule, I am a free(void *human); \n while (!(ioccc(rule(you(are(number(6)))))) {\n ha_ha_ha();\n } \n\n \nRule 6 is clearly a reference to The Prisoner... (Some other rules are even sillier...) And the guidelines include their own jokes:\n You are in a maze of twisty guidelines, all different. \n\nThere are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.... \n\n\nWe suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' source. The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.\n \n\nAnd this weekend there was also a second announcement:\n\nAfter a 4 year effort by a number of people, with over 6168+ commits, the Great Fork Merge has been completed and the Official IOCCC web site has been updated! A significant number of improvements has been made to the IOCCC winning entries. A number of fixes and improvements involve the ability of reasonable modern Unix/Linux systems to be able to compile and even run them. \n\nThanks to long-time Slashdot reader &mdash; and C programmer &mdash; achowe for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status='International+Obfuscated+C+Code+Contest'+Will+Relaunch%2C+Celebrating+40th+Anniversary%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F1730224%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F1730224%2Finternational-obfuscated-c-code-contest-will-relaunch-celebrating-40th-anniversary%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/1730224/international-obfuscated-c-code-contest-will-relaunch-celebrating-40th-anniversary?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

I proposed a solution for the latter which got rightfully rejected.</p> <p>Another issue I had was the overwhelming complexity of the nutype code, I got lost a few times reading it and felt that some limitations were maybe unnecessary.</p> <p>So I decided to try to make my own proc-macro inspired by nutype during my free-time over 3 weeks.</p> <p>I&#39;m very happy with the results and would love to get your advices about the project, the code etc...</p> <p>The crate allows you to declare newtypes like this and doesn&#39;t enforce much on you beside syntax and obvious footguns. ```rs use nnn::nnn;</p> <h1>[nnn(</h1> <pre><code>derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord), nnn_derive(TryFrom), consts( ZERO = 0.0_f64, pub ONE = 1.0_f64, ), default = 5.0_f64, validators(finite, positive), sanitizers(custom = |v: f64| v.abs()), // Serialize &amp; Deserialize are only available in test env. cfg(test, derive(Serialize, Deserialize)), attrs( repr(transparent), ), </code></pre> <p>)] struct PositiveFiniteFloat(f64); ``` Hope you&#39;ll like it !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vic1707_2\"> /u/vic1707_2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hovz1p/nnn_a_new_take_on_nutype/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hovz1p/nnn_a_new_take_on_nutype/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "\"Over the course of 2024, Python has proven again and again why it's one of the most popular, useful, and promising programming languages out there,\" writes InfoWorld:\n\nThe latest version of the language pushes the envelope further for speed and power, sheds many of Python's most decrepit elements, and broadens its appeal with developers worldwide. Here's a look back at the year in Python. \n\nIn the biggest news of the year, the core Python development team took a major step toward overcoming one of Python's longstanding drawbacks: the Global Interpreter Lock or \"GIL,\" a mechanism for managing interpreter state. The GIL prevents data corruption across threads in Python programs, but it comes at the cost of making threads nearly useless for CPU-bound work. Over the years, various attempts to remove the GIL ended in tears, as they made single-threaded Python programs drastically slower. But the most recent no-GIL project goes a long way toward fixing that issue &mdash; enough that it's been made available for regular users to try out. \n\nThe no-GIL or \"free-threaded\" builds are still considered experimental, so they shouldn't be deployed in production yet. The Python team wants to alleviate as much of the single-threaded performance impact as possible, along with any other concerns, before giving the no-GIL builds the full green light. It's also entirely possible these builds may never make it to full-blown production-ready status, but the early signs are encouraging. \nAnother forward-looking feature introduced in Python 3.13 is the experimental just-in-time compiler or JIT. It expands on previous efforts to speed up the interpreter by generating machine code for certain operations at runtime. Right now, the speedup doesn't amount to much (maybe 5% for most programs), but future versions of Python will expand the JIT's functionality where it yields real-world payoffs.\n \nPython is now more widely used than JavaScript on GitHub (thanks partly to its role in AI and data science code).<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Python+in+2024%3A+Faster%2C+More+Powerful%2C+and+More+Popular+Than+Ever%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0534253%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0534253%2Fpython-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/0534253/python-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

Everything I am doing is working thus far, so I don&#39;t have an exact problem, but I feel like I don&#39;t have a good mental model of how to handle HTTP responses (this is all from the server&#39;s perspective btw). I&#39;ve done a lot of googling and looking for Github examples/best practices but haven&#39;t found the specifics I&#39;m looking for.</p> <p>Some example questions I have:</p> <ul> <li>When and how do you write whatever headers you need to add to the <code>ResponseWriter</code>? I&#39;ve found for websocket upgrades, I need to set them and then call <code>WriteHeader</code>, which seems to actually send the response to the client immediately? For normal HTTP I set headers using <code>Header().Set()</code> and not <code>WriteHeader</code>, but I sort of accidentally came across this, as I don&#39;t have a good mental model</li> <li>Can any headers be added <em>after</em> you&#39;re written to the body of the response?</li> <li>What is the best way to write to the body itself? I&#39;m currently using <code>fmt.Fprintf</code>, as the <code>ResponseWriter.Write()</code> method does some stuff (like <em>&quot;If [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] has not yet been called, Write calls WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data.&quot;</em>) that I don&#39;t fully understand.</li> <li>Is the standard practice to create a new response object and return it, or just modify the <code>ResponseWriter</code>? (I modify it)</li> <li>Are there any gotchas I should know about? I know there&#39;s something about not being able to read from the request after you&#39;ve read once. Another is <code>Header().Set()</code> vs. <code>Header().Add()</code></li> <li>Is it good practice to set all your headers as soon as possible, then do your processing and write to the response body, then return?</li> </ul> <p>Summed up, I&#39;m trying to improve my mental model of the request lifetime, the proper order of writing parts of the response, and best practices.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AgreeableServe965\"> /u/AgreeableServe965 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1honb3w/order_of_writing_to_an_http_server_response_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1honb3w/order_of_writing_to_an_http_server_response_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Some of you might remember me from my last post here. I thought I had it solved, and then I edited my deployments so that certain pods would go on certain machines, and that broke everything again.</p> <p>I&#39;ve learned from last time, and here&#39;s everything I have to give.</p> <p>I&#39;ve exec-ed into the MySQL pod, made sure the username and password for wordpress is the same as what is setup in the secret.</p> <p>The database is indeed running as confirmed with MySQL workbench when I make it external. Plus if i mash F5 on the &quot;Error establishing a database connection&quot; screen I can see the CPU spike on the mysql pod in the kubernetes dashboard, a bit caveman I know, but it shows that Wordpress is at least reaching MySQL. So it&#39;s not any issue with internal networking.</p> <p>Given how I had a bit of an issue with passwords and the mysql root password a little while ago, I think it&#39;s something to do with that.</p> <p>If i ignore the secret file and put everything to plain text, that still gets me the error however.</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated, and happy to help you help me.

Here's the pitch:<p><i>Anki AI Utils</i> is a suite of AI-powered tools designed to automatically improve cards you find challenging. Whether you're studying medicine, languages, or any complex subject, these tools can:<p>- <i>Explain</i> difficult concepts with clear, ChatGPT-generated explanations.<p>- <i>Illustrate</i> key ideas using Dall-E or Stable Diffusion-generated images.<p>- <i>Create mnemonics</i> tailored to your memory style, including support for the Major System.<p>- <i>Reformulate</i> poorly worded cards for clarity and better retention.<p><i>Key Features:</i><p>- <i>Adaptive Learning:</i> Uses semantic similarity to match cards with relevant examples.<p>- <i>Personalized Memory Hooks:</i> Builds on your existing mnemonics for stronger recall.<p>- <i>Automation Ready:</i> Run scripts daily to enhance cards you struggled with.<p>- <i>Universal Compatibility:</i> Works across all Anki clients (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS).<p><i>Example:</i><p>For a flashcard about febrile seizures, Anki AI Utils can:<p>- Generate a <i>Dall-E illustration</i> of a toddler holding a teacup next to a fireplace.<p>- Create <i>mnemonics</i> like \"A child stumbles near the fire, dances symmetrically, has one strike, and fewer than three fires.\"<p>- Provide an <i>explanation</i> of why febrile seizures occur and their diagnostic criteria.<p><i>Call for Contributors:</i><p>This project is battle-tested but needs help to become a polished Anki addon.

I think I am able to capture the ideas I wanted to express in Wendy and would love to know what you all think!</p> <p>It&#39;s still a work in progress but is usable and has all the aspects of a CLI tooling that one would expect.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m an intermediate Rust programmer. Recently I&#39;ve taken an interest in the doukutsu-rs project, a mostly complete re-implementation Cave Story in Rust.</p> <p>Perusing the code, I noticed the memory safety in the engine&#39;s NPC list is severely lacking. It is very easy to create two mutable references to the same NPC, which my Rust knowledge tells me is a safety violation on the level of &quot;your computer might explode&quot;. Basically, it is forbidden.</p> <p>I wrote a PR to improve the safety. Here is a link, starting at src/game/npc/list.rs: <a href=\"https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs/pull/296/files#diff-2eb94e5c5ef1c61ce68a44bf8fc00ff9a53a292276577e9c40c40d718913cc93\">https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs/pull/296/files#diff-2eb94e5c5ef1c61ce68a44bf8fc00ff9a53a292276577e9c40c40d718913cc93</a></p> <p>Note that the original code uses UnsafeCells to store the NPC&#39;s. The original programmer used this as a somewhat crude way to bypass the borrow checker. There are no guards against taking multiple mutable references to an NPC, and in fact the engine will peek in at mutably borrowed NPC&#39;s to check the &quot;alive&quot; flag.</p> <p>The PR changes the NPC list to use RefCells.</p> <p>On each frame, the game runs through every living NPC and calls a tick function on it. The problem is, the tick function might need to access the NPC list to spawn new NPC&#39;s, kill NPC&#39;s, or change the state of existing NPC&#39;s. This is why NPC&#39;s must be wrapped in Cells. Without cells, borrowing one NPC would cause the entire NPC list to become immutably borrowed and impossible to manipulate.</p> <p>There is an iterator to scan through &quot;alive&quot; NPC&#39;s. Since peeking in at the &quot;alive&quot; flag is impossible while an NPC is borrowed, I made the iterator skip over NPC&#39;s that are borrowed.</p> <p>Before:</p> <p><code>if !npc_ref.cond.alive() {</code></p> <p>After:</p> <p><code>if npc_ref.try_borrow().is_ok_and(|npc_ref| !npc_ref.cond.alive()) {</code></p> <p>The big problem is, there are hundreds of objects in the game and it&#39;s hard to tell if some NPC logic relies on being able to view NPC that is already borrowed. This PR could cause subtle logic errors, which is why I&#39;ve labeled it &quot;do not merge&quot;.</p> <p>I thought about overhauling the NPC tick logic so instead of calling &quot;tick(&amp;mut self, ...)&quot; on the object, it becomes &quot;tick(self_: &amp;RefCell&lt;NPC&gt;&quot;. Then, the NPC logic could drop all its borrows before accessing the NPC list. However, the notion of filling the NPC logic with &quot;borrow()&quot; and &quot;borrow_mut()&quot; is daunting.</p> <p>So I&#39;m asking for advice. What do Rustaceans think of my approach? Is there a better solution I&#39;m missing? How would other Rust programmers tackle this problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/beholdnec\"> /u/beholdnec </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hnx9nm/improving_safety_in_doukutsurs_npc_list_request/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hnx9nm/improving_safety_in_doukutsurs_npc_list_request/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I recently created a parameter parser for Axum that aims to bring Ruby on Rails-like parameter handling to Rust: <a href=\"https://github.com/cpunion/axum-params\">https://github.com/cpunion/axum-params</a></p> <h2>Motivation</h2> <p>I found myself writing significantly more code in Rust compared to Rails for similar functionality. My Rust controllers were often several times longer, especially when handling file uploads and complex parameter structures. I wanted to streamline this.</p> <h2>What it does</h2> <p>The library provides a Rails-inspired parameter parser that: - Unifies handling of Query/Path/Form/JSON/Multipart parameters - Supports complex tree-like data structures - Handles multiple file objects efficiently - Allows multiple parameter types in a single controller - Currently implements parameter parsing for Axum</p> <h2>Context</h2> <p>While Axum&#39;s extractors are efficient, they have limitations - like not being able to use JSON and Multipart simultaneously since they both consume the request body. File upload handling can also be cumbersome.</p> <h2>Technical Journey</h2> <p>Following my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hl3wxy/how_to_implement_custom_deserialization_for_a/\">previous post</a>, I explored various approaches through Reddit, Stack Overflow, and the Rust Discord community. The main challenge was that we can&#39;t directly deserialize a <code>tokio::fs::File</code> into struct fields. The compromise was to create a pseudo-file object that deserializes temporary file paths and provides an <code>open</code> method to access the file.</p> <h2>Current Limitations</h2> <ol> <li>Due to the indirect file object deserialization, I added a <code>files</code> field in the Params object for automatic cleanup of temporary files. Users need to include an unused &quot;_&quot; parameter in declarations, which feels inelegant.</li> <li>As my first side project in Rust and first published crate, the codebase is partially AI-generated with manual corrections. While functional, I&#39;m uncertain about potential issues.</li> <li>Documentation is currently minimal. I&#39;m curious if others face similar needs and would be interested in collaborating on improvements.</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;d greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions for improvements, or interest in contributing to the project.

As a network guy, over the years I&#39;ve had to do things like copy a firmware update file to a tens or low hundreds of routers, or ping a bunch of hosts to see which ones were up, and <code>parallel</code> made those jobs really easy.</p> <p>You know what I don&#39;t like about <code>parallel</code>? It&#39;s got defaults that don&#39;t work for me (one job per core when I&#39;m blocking on network I/O is hugely inefficient). Its CLI is convoluted (yes, it&#39;s a hard problem to solve in general, but still). It&#39;s got a 120-page manual or a 20-minute training video to teach you how to use it. It&#39;s written in Perl. It has this weird thing where it can&#39;t do CSV right out of the box and you have to do manual CPAN stuff. Ain&#39;t nobody got time for any of that. </p> <p>And worst of all, it has that weird gold-digging &#39;I agree under penalty of death to cite parallel in any academic work&#39; clause. I understand that it&#39;s reasonable to ask for credit for writing free software, but if everyone did it the way <code>parallel</code> does then the whole open source industry would drown itself in a pool of compliance paperwork.</p> <p>Plus it&#39;s always cool to learn a new language by using it to solve a problem rather than grinding on leetcode.</p> <p>So I give you <code>concur</code>. I&#39;m never going to claim it&#39;s as fully featured as <code>parallel</code> but it does the bits I need, it&#39;s a few hundred lines of go, it has sensible defaults for things which aren&#39;t compute-bound, it has easy to read json output. It can flag jobs which exit with a return code other than zero. It can run all your jobs, or it can stop when the first one teminates. It&#39;s got an easy syntax for subbing in the thing you&#39;re iterating over (each entry in a list of hosts, for example).</p> <p>It does what I want and it does it well, all using <code>go&#39;s</code> built-in concurrency. Thus, <code>concur</code> (which as a verb is a <a href=\"https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/parallel\">synonym</a> for parallel).</p> <p>This project is very much under active development so the screen scrapes here may not match what&#39;s in the latest code but it&#39;ll be close.</p> <p>I also do not write code for a living so this started out clean and idiomatic and turned into a bit of a spaghetti mess. I&#39;ll clean it up eventually, once the feature set stabilizes. It has also almost no testing other than me running stuff by hand after every build. Testing is hard. </p> <p>Comments and PRs welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EricWOsborne\"> /u/EricWOsborne </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hnrvpa/concur_a_replacement_for_the_parts_of_gnu/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hnrvpa/concur_a_replacement_for_the_parts_of_gnu/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Then product managers review the feature, realize specs weren’t followed, and the vicious cycle starts again.</p> <p>That’s why I built <a href=\"https://get-nexify.vercel.app/\">Nexify AI</a>: a tool designed to accelerate backend development by turning specs into <strong>secure, scalable microservices, fully tested, and Kubernetes-ready.</strong> My vision?

Done in minutes. No guesswork, no late-night infra panic attacks.</p> <p>Here’s where it gets exciting: product managers, engineers, even devops teams can tweak the specs, and the AI generates a new PR with updated features, tests, and documentation. It’s like turning endless review cycles into a single, fast iteration.</p> <p>I’m opening it up now because I want to know:</p> <ul> <li>Does this hit a pain point for you?</li> <li>What’s your biggest backend struggle right now?</li> <li>Would you pay for something like this? <strong>(As I figured—AI infra is token-draining as hell, so I need to sort that out.

Simple to the point where all setup is done by editing the html source file and there is only one freeform \"weight\" textbox per exercise to manipulate. Data is autosaved as it is entered. It never nags or judges you except by showing the last date you entered data in for that day-of-the-week's exercises. The only quality-of-life feature is a super-simple rest period timer in the footer.<p>It has no external dependencies and only uses browser local storage. There is no possibility of monetizing it.<p>I was on the fence about sharing since it is such a small and simple project, but decided I would share here in case anyone is looking to make a fresh start in the new year and finds the philosophy appealing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526769\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526769</a></p>\n<p>Points: 115</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>\n",

It doesnt work until i add the entry of “namespace.svc.cluster.local” in the etc/resolv.conf of the worker node. So it means everytime i create a new namespace and deploy my application i have to add dns entry in all worker nodes etc/resolv.conf? I installed busybox for debugging and i found out i cant nslookup for kubernetes.default i get NxError but when i nslookup kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local i get expected result i.e 10.96.0.1. I chatgped and searched everywhere but i cant figure this out please help me</p> <p>Just for further context i m using calico for networking my pod CIDR is 172.24.0.0/16 and my host network is on 192.168.x.x</p> <p>UPDATE: after one of the comment’s recommendations i uninstalled calico and gave cilium a try. I chose 10.244.0.0/24 as my pod cidr and I successfully installed it. Now everything was looking good cilium test -wait showed all good. But when i do cilium connectivity test it deploys a sample app and service for testing the connectivity and it failed at the step below</p> <p>timeout reached waiting for NodePort 192.168.250.114:31457 (cilium-test-1/echo-same-node) (last error: error with exec request (pod=cilium-test-1/client-b65598b6f-knt7l, container=): context deadline exceeded: &quot;&quot;) Please note this is master node and my worker node passed this test successfully. Then i did actual field test of my DNS resolution. And yes it worked everything was resolving nicely. But heres the new problem. Now lets say you deploy a service as NodePort on your any worker nodes. You access it from outside using workernodeip:nodeport it works but when i use masternodeip:nodeport it fails. This should work coz kube-proxy is there it doesn’t matter which node ip you use it should work so any idea guys ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayCupcake9745\"> /u/HolidayCupcake9745 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hnpw8h/kubernetes_dns_resolution_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hnpw8h/kubernetes_dns_resolution_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",

A webapp that brings drawings to life using AI and stores them as memories. You can always look back at the drawings, see who made them, and even know the age they were drawn at.<p>I thought it was a fun way to preserve those memories. What do you think?<p>Viktor</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42524848\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42524848</a></p>\n<p>Points: 214</p>\n<p># Comments: 75</p>\n",
