As nice as it sounds to replace your aging RX580 or 1080Ti with something from this decade, please remember that decent Linux support for new hardware is <em>not</em> guaranteed for days, weeks, or even months after the hardware is actually released. Features might be missing, performance might be atrocious, bugs or crashes may be common, and it&#39;s even possible your distribution won&#39;t support the software required.</p> <p>As an example, take the AMD 7000 series GPUs. The first GPU released was the 7900 XTX in December 2022, which <em>technically</em> had initial support in the 6.0 kernel from October 2022 and Mesa 22.2 in September. However, there were significant performance issues and features missing until the 6.2 kernel was released in February 2023 and Mesa 23.1 in May.</p> <p>That means you purchased a $1k card that was not fully usable for 5 whole months after the fact. And even that was only if you were using a bleeding-edge Linux distribution that packaged the required software. It might have been another couple of months before it landed in your repos.</p> <p>It&#39;s not just GPUs either. That fancy new X870E motherboard you are looking to buy might have a Realtek device that&#39;s not supported in the kernel yet. Or the built-in Wi-Fi card might not have proper Wi-Fi 6E or 7 support for another couple months. Or there&#39;s a BIOS issue that only shows up on Linux that won&#39;t get a fix until next year.</p> <p>So determine which features you need and which you can live without. Do your research on what software is required to support those features. Try to see if there are bug reports or issues filed that might affect you. And understand that you might run into problems that have not yet been reported.</p> <p>Most of all, remember that being an early adopter means you are paying the highest price for the worst experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mocket_ponsters\"> /u/mocket_ponsters </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hsvc52/gentle_reminder_for_people_looking_to_get_newly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hsvc52/gentle_reminder_for_people_looking_to_get_newly/\">[comments]</a></span>",

However it&#39;s very slow to start, all the research i&#39;ve made lead me to believe this is because of it&#39;s dependence on GTK. While other terms like kitty, alacritty can start in under 0.30s, ghostty needs over a second to start. Even with gtk-single-instance on, subsequent starts can be fast but the first instance of ghostty will always be very slow. This is quite a drawback because in truth many linux users dont care about gtk or a &quot;native feel&quot; for apps, alot of users just use a tiling window manager or compositor and would much prefer a bare bones emulator that just starts without initializing gtk or qt in the background.</p> <p>Maybe i&#39;m doing something wrong, but i hope later on there is an option to to run ghostty without any dependence on gtk and it can just draw the terminal on a simple X or Wayland surface.

However, other people would prefer a GUI. The reason many programs use text-based configuration (in my opinion) is because its easier to implement and developers generally tend to be more comfortable with it anyway. FOSS developers are less motivated to spend more of their free time implementing a configuration method they don&#39;t even prefer themselves.</p> <p>My idea is this: We now have things like <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\">JSON schema</a>. These schemas can often even be generated from source code, so there is very little effort for developers to provide JSON schemas for their app configuration. A generic configuration GUI would then take 2 inputs: the location of the config file and the JSON schema. From that, it would render a GUI that allows editing the configuration in a way that complies with the schema. (JSON schemas can also validate toml and yaml files as far as I&#39;m aware.)</p> <p>There could also be some community-driven database of apps and their corresponding config file location. With that, users could fuzzy-search for the app they want to configure and never have to worry about the config file location. I just found <a href=\"https://www.schemastore.org/json/\">JSON Schema Store</a> and it looks promising, at least I&#39;m imagining something similar.</p> <p>Is anyone aware of something like this existing? I think it could be a very time-effective way to make Linux and its awesome FOSS ecosystem more accessible to more casual computer users.</p> <p>Also, if you have opinions, inputs, concerns or questions about the idea, I would love to hear them!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/senekor\"> /u/senekor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hrspgv/generic_configuration_gui/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hrspgv/generic_configuration_gui/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I updated, made sure all my additional apps are working (notably AltTab and Rectangle), and put it back to my locker, since Linux is my main OS.</p> <p>Today I took it out to update to 15.2, with intent to use it a bit, evaluate how it&#39;s standing. And I was just stunned on how much Apple treats MacOS users like complete blithering idiots.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, end user, do you want this antivirus software, that you yourself installed to have access to your storage? Cool, I&#39;ll allow it for 30 days and ask you again, maybe you change your mind!&quot;</p> <p>Like what? Why 30 days? Why would I EVER want to revoke access to my storage FROM AN ANTIVIRUS?! Let alone in 30 days?</p> <p>But the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back for me was this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uaondjbdqgae1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b93e3b27e993e560a3d3b92299e4ed09ee6b8679\">https://preview.redd.it/uaondjbdqgae1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b93e3b27e993e560a3d3b92299e4ed09ee6b8679</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/okay-thats-some-prime-level-bs-and-treating-your-user-like-v0-cjb26ktjogae1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0321dab408f17cc8bec54aa7f00f27cfa7e1e6af\"></a></p> <p>YES! I KNOW! I ALLOWED IT! I CHANGED THE SETTING MANUALLY TO ALLOW IT!</p> <p>And it would be cool if this showed once. No problem. Click &quot;Okay, cool&quot;.</p> <p>NO. This notification pops up EVERY TIME I open a new window or use Alt-Tab. And it stacks! So if I hop around windows a bunch I have like 60 of these notifications.</p> <p>&quot;...accessed your screen and system audio 2 times...&quot;, &quot;...system audio 10 times...&quot;, &quot;...56 times...&quot;</p> <p>YES, I KNOW THAT! THANK YOU! NOW SHUT UP!</p> <p>I&#39;m just done. Literally done. I come from Linux, where the user is treated like adult, responsible and intelligent human being. If you&#39;re gonna do something actually dumb it will ask you once, and then trust, that you know what you&#39;re doing. But not MacOS. MacOS treats me like I&#39;m 3 years old. &quot;Hey, little Jimmy, are you SURE you want to do the thing you&#39;ve done 60 times already and every time you answered yes? Are you REALLY SURE?&quot;</p> <p>EDIT: A lot of you seem to think, I&#39;m against notifying user about accessing screen alltogether. NO, that is not the case. I very much support it! And it was a solved problem in MacOS. Prior to 15.2 when AltTab was using this privilege, a small purple icon with screen was appearing on the top bar. You could click it to see which apps are using the screen. Small enough to not disturb you (unlike notification bubble), but big enough to catch your attention. Very good solution! But now they replaced it with this bullshit notification, that does the same thing, except it blocks part of your screen and shows it every time the app is using this privilege (which is every time I alt-tab). This is a good feature. The implementation is just abyssmal.</p> <p>As for antivirus - this is company requirement enforced by security certification. And while it&#39;s fine by me to click &quot;Allow for 30 days&quot; every month, the problem arises with things like TeamViewer. If an employee clicks &quot;Don&#39;t allow&quot; by accident, now we don&#39;t have a way to connect to them to provide support. So yeah - not having &quot;Allow forever&quot; option is just bad.</p> <p>Like...

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As a person in the field of information technology, who also loves tinkering in their freetime, Ive had a bit of experience with linux. I was not looking forward to the switching process, since I was used to Windows. But I took it slowly for a year. I have not liked the direction Windows was going to, and seeing other proprietary companies following a similar path I decided open source is the only way to go. Ive been slowly switching my applications on the Windows machine to Linux compatible FOSS applications. As I got used to it and improved other privacy and security aspects in my life, I have decided to finish by the new year.</p> <p>I will be honest, it was quite a learning curve. Most of my experiences with Software was point and click. Ive never utilised the terminal/powershell in Windows besides executing a few Python scripts or changing settings and I honestly dont think Windows is worth my time to learn various commands (for now at least). But Linux fascinates me. Finally a file system that makes sense and is modular. I can imagine it being fun to develop applications for. And the Terminal is the heart of it all. An engineering marvel. I have expected it to be more of a pain to be honest. Developers have simplified the process for us so far that all you need is to download and run it. One example is running a game from Steam: Download Steam, force a game through Wine with a click of a button and install it. That is insane how much is occuring behind pressing a simple button. People have worked for months on it.</p> <p>FYI I went with Debian and KDE. Debian for its stability and security. Thourough testing is a must for me. I want to boot it, update it and be sure that the second after the update finishes, I can continue my work flow. Further I do not want my work station to be compromised which I not only use to work, but for my personal life (see CVE-2024-3094). I like KDE so far, will try other DEs soon. So far my plans are to experiment with a Linux VM and learn more. Heard about Linux from scratch. It fascinates me how much control you can have over something you own.</p> <p>So +1 person for Linux. Soon I will start assigning some amount of my income to donating for the projects that I use and others that I agree upon.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Different-Egg3510\"> /u/Different-Egg3510 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hr4mxx/finally_switched_to_linux_im_amazed/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hr4mxx/finally_switched_to_linux_im_amazed/\">[comments]</a></span>",

(But that was BackTrack 🌚) Truth be told, setting up the OS took very little time, and the longest part by very far was cleaning up old drives and rearranging the shit I&#39;ve been collecting on them for 20 years.</p> <p>Yesterday, it was all done, I could stream my very legal media library to every phone, TV and computer in the house without it buffering, and... Nobody cares lol It&#39;s basically free Netflix, it allows us to mirror back up our shared pictures, documents, etc, instead of constantly sending them by e-mail to each other, and to print from the only computer in the house with access to the printer.</p> <p>Oh well, 18 yo me would be very proud, and I&#39;m just happy I finally finalized a project all the way through.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ormidor\"> /u/Ormidor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hqgkus/i_made_a_media_server_and_nobody_cares/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hqgkus/i_made_a_media_server_and_nobody_cares/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It wasn&#39;t until <a href=\"https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/7970\">2 months ago when the earlier was added to Kitty</a>. I did so much overthinking about which terminal to use, and realized that I wouldn&#39;t (and don&#39;t) use most of the features provided by ones like iTerm and Kitty, though I picked the later. I was pleasantly surprised to see it added, even if it could use more work to make long smooth cursor animations like Neovide. The only other feature I want is smooth scrolling, I can&#39;t believe there are no modern terminals with it.</p> <p><strong>(Somewhat) Side note:</strong> At this point many users realized that Ghostty got over-hyped, here is Mitchell Hashimoto&#39;s (dev of Ghostty) thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-1-0-reflection\">https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-1-0-reflection</a><br/> Ghostty: Reflecting on Reaching 1.0 – Mitchell Hashimoto </p> <p>I didn&#39;t anticipate the hype. Some people think I am lying when I say this. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not so naive to think that private betas and exclusive access don&#39;t generate hype <em>in principle</em>. But I didn&#39;t think many people at all would be interested in a terminal emulator. I thought I was building boring software for a niche audience. No hype! But I was wrong, and the consequences were real. People were frustrated that they couldn&#39;t get in. People felt left out. People felt like I was being fake to generate hype. The waitlist grew larger than I was comfortable allowing in (given my prior stated priorities). I&#39;m sorry about that. All I can say is that I didn&#39;t intend for this to happen. I ramped up beta invites to try to get as many people in as I felt comfortable with (well, a bit beyond that). We ended the beta at around 5,000 users in a Discord of 28,000 at the time. Not quite the percentage of access I wanted for people but more than I could handle.<br/> ...</p> <p><strong>One more negative aspect of the hype is the expectation of Ghostty being revolutionary.</strong> It is and it isn&#39;t. Ghostty has different goals and tradeoffs than other terminals. For those looking for those properties, Ghostty is a breath of fresh air and does things that no other terminal does. But for others, it&#39;s just a terminal. And that&#39;s okay. I hope you find a terminal that works for you and I don&#39;t claim that Ghostty is the end all be all of terminals.</p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTwelveYearOld\"> /u/TheTwelveYearOld </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hqg57y/in_2025_what_features_do_you_want_in_a_terminal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hqg57y/in_2025_what_features_do_you_want_in_a_terminal/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have done an extensive search on the Global Brand Database (WIPO) and just about everything that I entered was taken and this name was free / unused. Also, I have uploaded more screenshots for you to see. The first one shows a different panel configuration (dock style with auto size) along the awesome search capabilities of the file manager. The second one shows a different panel theme and the built-in clipboard manager (read the description in it) and the third shows one part of the dashboard.</p> <p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/U7ssH91\">https://imgur.com/a/U7ssH91</a></p> <p>A full video demo and screenshots will be released soon.</p> <p>Not everything will be ready when it gets released but I will try to get done as much as possible by 31/12/2024.

I understand that it&#39;s cross-platform and GPU-accelerated. But what I mean is –– in the real world, what is the typical developer gaining by switching to this terminal from, say, Alacritty? What&#39;s the value proposition? Are there things Ghostty can do that other terminals can&#39;t? Do those things matter? Do any of these Rust/Zig/Go &quot;high-performance&quot; terminal emulators actually matter for the regular-brained developer?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jsonathan\"> /u/jsonathan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn700x/what_are_the_meaningful_differences_between/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn700x/what_are_the_meaningful_differences_between/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I can donate to the front end packages but do they distribute the funding to their dev/make/runtime dependency packages? </p> <p>Perhaps bash is a dependency for about half my programs.
