Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nDynamic Management of X509 Certificates Using Kubernetes Certificate Operator - Abhidnya Joshi & Senthil Ponnuswamy, Dell Technologies\n\nSecurity is non-negotiable area and Kubernetes based environments are no exception! Usage of x509 certificates is the key thing. Be it K8s deployments in private or public cloud, ensuring availability of \"right\" X509 certificate for a service is very important. If this service is getting connected from external (apps/clients which are outside of K8s cluster) clients, this is even more important! But what is really the \"right\" x509 certificate and how can we ensure that is always remains \"right\"? Can we make corrections dynamically? Can we also ensure easy propagation of certificates imported from outside the cluster? Propagation of Certificate revocation lists to ensure services can deny revoked certificates?\n\nThis talk helps describe the strategy K8s based products can use to dynamically generate, make correction and propagation of X509 certificates within K8s cluster using K8s operator design pattern and makes use of well-known CNCF projects such as cert-manager and trust-manager.",

As nice as it sounds to replace your aging RX580 or 1080Ti with something from this decade, please remember that decent Linux support for new hardware is <em>not</em> guaranteed for days, weeks, or even months after the hardware is actually released. Features might be missing, performance might be atrocious, bugs or crashes may be common, and it&#39;s even possible your distribution won&#39;t support the software required.</p> <p>As an example, take the AMD 7000 series GPUs. The first GPU released was the 7900 XTX in December 2022, which <em>technically</em> had initial support in the 6.0 kernel from October 2022 and Mesa 22.2 in September. However, there were significant performance issues and features missing until the 6.2 kernel was released in February 2023 and Mesa 23.1 in May.</p> <p>That means you purchased a $1k card that was not fully usable for 5 whole months after the fact. And even that was only if you were using a bleeding-edge Linux distribution that packaged the required software. It might have been another couple of months before it landed in your repos.</p> <p>It&#39;s not just GPUs either. That fancy new X870E motherboard you are looking to buy might have a Realtek device that&#39;s not supported in the kernel yet. Or the built-in Wi-Fi card might not have proper Wi-Fi 6E or 7 support for another couple months. Or there&#39;s a BIOS issue that only shows up on Linux that won&#39;t get a fix until next year.</p> <p>So determine which features you need and which you can live without. Do your research on what software is required to support those features. Try to see if there are bug reports or issues filed that might affect you. And understand that you might run into problems that have not yet been reported.</p> <p>Most of all, remember that being an early adopter means you are paying the highest price for the worst experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mocket_ponsters\"> /u/mocket_ponsters </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hsvc52/gentle_reminder_for_people_looking_to_get_newly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hsvc52/gentle_reminder_for_people_looking_to_get_newly/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The researchers successfully tested their conversion system on two major code libraries, including the 80,000-line HACL* cryptographic library. Parts of the converted code have already been integrated into Mozilla's NSS and OpenSSH security systems, according to the researchers. Memory safety errors account for 76% of Android vulnerabilities in 2019.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=New+System+Auto-Converts+C+To+Memory-Safe+Rust%2C+But+There's+a+Catch%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F133213%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F03%2F133213%2Fnew-system-auto-converts-c-to-memory-safe-rust-but-theres-a-catch%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/03/133213/new-system-auto-converts-c-to-memory-safe-rust-but-theres-a-catch?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>",

Users can compress, convert, resize, and do so much more with easy-to-use tools.<p>Background: I developed a frame-by-frame video cropper to upload cropped landscape videos to Instagram Reels. However, it required FFmpeg, and as a noob video editor, I decided to incorporate more user-friendly video tools. I then introduced image and audio tools to maximize the capabilities of FFmpeg. I use my app daily, and it has surprisingly generated a few thousand dollars for me.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585009\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585009</a></p>\n<p>Points: 87</p>\n<p># Comments: 26</p>\n",

Since the data is needed for every request (yes 600gb data for every request) I setup nodes to have this directory prior to k8s setup and provide it to pods with hostpath and I am happy with the raw performance.</p> <p>- however, there is one more directory which is not as heavy as the other one but it is still heavy. And this time it is readwrite directory. I had run some experiments. Below are my experiments and problems and thoughts.</p> <ol> <li>testing hostpath local ()<br/></li> <li><p>testing hostpath volume (cloud provider&#39;s elastic volume)</p></li> <li><p>test longhorn local with data locality </p></li> <li><p>test longhorn local without data locality </p></li> <li><p>test longhorn volume with data locality </p></li> <li><p>test longhorn volume without data locality</p></li> </ol> <p>Of course hostpath gives the best performance however I cannot scale across nodes. I am thinking of creating manuel sync etc. or looking for volume sync tool.</p> <p>When I try longhorn I am a bit disappointed. Before, I didn&#39;t need to work on such big datasets and it was okey to just mount with rwx. Even when there is data locality, longhorn causes a performance drop. For example, for a local hostpath I get 1GB/s. When I create a volume with longhorn I get around 100MB/s.</p> <p>Btw, we use cloud only for staging environments for regulatory reasons. I was also disappointed when I learn that elastic volumes are not as fast as local (rookie mistake).</p> <p>To sum up, I want to somehow create and manage volumes that can are rwx and can be mounted to pods across nodes for scalability. Is longhorn the best I can use? That is, is it impossible to achieve something like this?</p> <p>I look forward to anything that helps actually.

However it&#39;s very slow to start, all the research i&#39;ve made lead me to believe this is because of it&#39;s dependence on GTK. While other terms like kitty, alacritty can start in under 0.30s, ghostty needs over a second to start. Even with gtk-single-instance on, subsequent starts can be fast but the first instance of ghostty will always be very slow. This is quite a drawback because in truth many linux users dont care about gtk or a &quot;native feel&quot; for apps, alot of users just use a tiling window manager or compositor and would much prefer a bare bones emulator that just starts without initializing gtk or qt in the background.</p> <p>Maybe i&#39;m doing something wrong, but i hope later on there is an option to to run ghostty without any dependence on gtk and it can just draw the terminal on a simple X or Wayland surface.

This can be incredibly useful in scenarios where you need to serialize the same data structure differently depending on the context, such as for different API versions or formats.</p> <p>This crate was inspired by the discussion in this <a href=\"https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1443\">Serde issue</a> and aims to provide a flexible solution for handling different serialization needs in an idiomatic way (the <a href=\"https://github.com/swfsql/serde_many\">previous solution</a> went full non-idiomatic).</p> <h1>Example</h1> <pre><code>/// Marker for the default serde implementation. struct Default; /// Marker for a special serde implementation. struct Special; #[derive(SerializeMany, DeserializeMany)] #[serde_many(default = &quot;Default&quot;, special = &quot;Special&quot;)] // Declaring the implementation markers. struct Point { #[serde(special(rename = &quot;x_value&quot;))] x: i32, #[serde(special(rename = &quot;y_value&quot;))] y: i32, } </code></pre> <p>In this example, the Point struct has two different serialization implementations. The default implementation behaves normally, while the &quot;special&quot; implementation renames the fields during serialization to x_value and y_value.</p> <p>I&#39;m excited to hear what the community thinks about it. I&#39;d love to get feedback on potential use cases, feature ideas, or any improvements that come to mind!</p> <p>Thanks for taking a look, and happy coding!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SufficientSir814\"> /u/SufficientSir814 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hskd6r/new_crate_serde_many_multiple/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hskd6r/new_crate_serde_many_multiple/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;ve learned that for multiplexing/routing net/http isn&#39;t sufficient enough, so everybody uses a web framework. I&#39;ve read that among most common ones are Gin, Chi, Fiber. I know that Gorilla Mux had been the most popular one, but I&#39;ve read it was archived over a year ago then revived by Red Hat, and the overall popularity has been declining. For educational purposes I&#39;ve made some simple Gin and Gorilla Mux server implementations, and I have a good impression so far.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s been about two months since I wrote about go-dom, a headless browser written in Go, with JavaScript support by embedding a v8 engine, and I now reached the 2nd major milestone: </p> <p><strong>Go-dom now supports a very basic HTMX app with interactivity.</strong></p> <p>The project is still in development, and has yet to reach a level of usability. The API is not yet stable, but after a recent code restructure, I believe I am approaching a sensible structure, as well as public API.</p> <p>You can find it at <a href=\"https://github.com/stroiman/go-dom\">github.com/stroiman/go-dom</a></p> <h2>The interactive HTMX app</h2> <p>The application is as simple as it can be. A web page that shows a counter. When you click the counter, it increments, and the new value is shown instead.</p> <p>But as this is HTMX, there are quite a few things that needed to be implemented for this to work, including an <code>XmlHttpRequest</code> implementation, along with <code>FormData</code>, a basic event loop, CSS and XPath selectors (some parts implemented in JS), iterators, event bubbling, class lists, DOM parsing, <code>DocumentFragment</code>, and <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> elements support, just to name a few (phew).</p> <p>I also invested time in code generations, and parts of the implementation are now generated automatically based on IDL specifications from <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/webref\">github.com/w4c/webref</a>. Older hand-coded implementations will over time be replaced with generated ones.</p> <h2>Goal of the project</h2> <p>The purpose is to have a library that can help test web applications written in Go, where the behaviour has more complexity than just serving server-side rendered HTML.</p> <p>It is specifically written with HTMX/Go in mind, a tech combination that seems to be gaining in popularity.</p> <p>The focus is driving the implementation of behaviour. For HTMX, the actual behaviour is the result of a choreography between HTML element attributes, JavaScript code, and the endpoints and responses generated by the Go web server.</p> <p>It is intended to support a TDD loop, where a fast feedback loop is the catalyst to an increase in productivity. It is the ability to specify application behaviour that is at focus here.</p> <p>While not there yet, a modularised design is desired. First, so the user can speed up the build time by only using the modules relevant for their specific project. But second, the user can customise, or provide their own implementations when relevant for testing a specific feature. See motivating example in the next section.</p> <p>One unique feature of this project is that you can operate directly on an <code>http.Handler</code> instance, bypassing the TCP layer entirely, and eliminating the latency of the TCP stack. Tests using go-dom can easily execute in sub-milliseconds.</p> <p>While it is a noble goal to have full spec compliance, usability is prioritised over compliance. For example, as this is intended to test <em>modern</em> web applications, I have no plans to support quirks-mode.</p> <h2>Why not use ... ?</h2> <p>For my last post, there was a few replies about alternate libraries. I knew about some of them, others I didn&#39;t. But they were all implemented using a <em>real</em> browser in headless mode, and as such has the overhead of launching a browser, as well as out-of-process communication with the browser.</p> <p>This is project is intended to provide the fastest possible feedback with the simplicity of just adding a Go library.</p> <p>A library also makes it easier to customise parts of the behaviour for what you need, by providing custom implementation for specific browser APIs. This could be</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation\">Geolocation</a> to test applications that track the position of the user</li> <li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API\">Authentication API</a> to test applications using e.g. biometric authentication.</li> </ul> <h3>Motivating example, GPS track</h3> <p>As an example for the usability of a library over an out-of process headless browser, imagine an application depends on the location API to track the location of the user over time. For testing purposes; you could have a GPX track of movements over a longer period of time. With a modularised headless browser as a native library, you could write a custom module for the location API that provides data from the GPX track, and replay that in your test.</p> <p>To get a fast running test, you have another option that wouldn&#39;t be easy with a real browser. You can fast forward time.</p> <p>Fast forwarding time is a planned feature, not yet implemented. (More precisely, real time isn&#39;t implemented. Currently there is no <code>setInterval</code>, and <code>setTimeout</code> ignores the timeout delay and executes the callback immediately)</p> <h2>Next Milestone</h2> <p>The next milestone will be handling of form interaction. This includes quite some behaviour on the browser side, as browsers exhibit quite a log of default behaviour, such as pressing enter in a form field will submit the form.</p> <p>This should also include sensible handling of browser history. As the user navigates the page, the browser history can be updated, allowing the user to have sensible behaviour going back and forth.</p> <h2>Appendix - Example code</h2> <p>Some examples showing code using go-dom. The tests are written using <a href=\"https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/\">ginkgo</a> and <a href=\"https://onsi.github.io/gomega/\">gomega</a>.</p> <h3>Simple usage example</h3> <p>A very basic example, where the browser loads a simple page with embedded script, and verifies that the side effects of the scripts are visible.</p> <p><code>go server := http.NewServeMux() server.Handle( &quot;GET /index.html&quot;, http.HandlerFunc(func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { res.Write([]byte(`&lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&#39;target&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; const target = document.getElementById(&#39;target&#39;); target.textContent = &quot;42&quot; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt;`)) }), ) browser := NewBrowserFromHandler(server) DeferCleanup(func() { browser.Dispose() }) win, err := browser.Open(&quot;/index.html&quot;) Expect(err).ToNot(HaveOccurred()) target := win.Document().GetElementById(&quot;target&quot;) Expect(target).To(HaveOuterHTML(Equal(`&lt;div id=&quot;target&quot;&gt;42&lt;/div&gt;`))) </code></p> <h2>HTMX Example</h2> <p>This is the working HTMX example, mentioned. The behaviour being the result of HTML element tags, and specific HTTP handlers.</p> <p>The HTML has a simple element that instructs HTMX to issue a <code>POST /increment</code> request on click</p> <p><code>html &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;/public/htmx.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div hx-trigger=&quot;click&quot; hx-post=&quot;/increment&quot; id=&quot;counter&quot;&gt;Count: 1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></p> <p>The simple test server serves the HTML file, as well as the POST handler, incrementing the contents.</p> <p><code>go func CreateServer() http.Handler { server := http.NewServeMux() count := 1 server.Handle(&quot;GET /&quot;, http.FileServer(http.FS(content.FS))) server.HandleFunc(&quot;POST /increment&quot;, func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { count++ res.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Count: %d&quot;, count))) }) return server } </code></p> <p>The tests issue a <code>click</code> on the element, and verifies that the count has been incremented.</p> <p><code>go var _ = Describe(&quot;Load from server&quot;, func() { It(&quot;Renders HTMX without errors&quot;, func() { browser := browser.NewBrowserFromHandler(app.CreateServer()) DeferCleanup(func() { browser.Dispose() }) win, err := browser.Open(&quot;/index.html&quot;) Expect(err).ToNot(HaveOccurred()) counter := win.Document().GetElementById(&quot;counter&quot;) Expect(counter).To(HaveInnerHTML(Equal(&quot;Count: 1&quot;))) // In principle, we should wait for an htmx:load event, currently `Open` // doesn&#39;t return until the window is fully loaded counter.Click() // Again, we should wait for an event, but in practice, the test doesn&#39;t // continue until the XHR request has been processed counter = win.Document().GetElementById(&quot;counter&quot;) Expect(counter).To(HaveInnerHTML(Equal(&quot;Count: 2&quot;))) }) }) </code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/stroiman\"> /u/stroiman </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hs8brn/my_crazy_idea_a_headless_browser_in_go_reached_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hs8brn/my_crazy_idea_a_headless_browser_in_go_reached_a/\">[comments]</a></span>",

People say Nvidia is shit on linux but I&#39;ve never had screen tearing compared to windows (where it was a huge problem) vr also has been no problem using ALVR on my quest 2. I have a few problems like davinci resolve not working but I am keeping linux so far and am not thinking about going back. This has been the most fun using my pc in years. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CodeEgg08\"> /u/CodeEgg08 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/wh077sanenae1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hs4xp5/my_first_month_of_daily_driving_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",

KEDA is scaling e.g. Kafka consumers (non webfacing tasks) to zero. </p> <p>Let’s say I want to run those tasks on a certain node. I can do this via node selector or node affinity. In my mind it would make sense to process such stuff everywhere but on the servers which deliver webcontent. </p> <p>So could I join my home pc‘s wsl to my cluster? If this node is available it should take those pods, otherwise not. </p> <p>I think the startups and shutdown of my system might be a problem. Also, how do longhorn and other things perform in such environments, I have the feeling joining nodes is quite slow. If I go this route I also need to ensure that no stuff like rancher gets scheduled on my wsl machine, would I need to manipulate all helm deployments etc? </p> <p>So yeah, thank you all in advance, the complexity of this leads me to think kubernetes might not be the tool for that job </p> <p>I‘m looking forward for your opinions and answers. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious-Cash-7685\"> /u/Suspicious-Cash-7685 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hs3yq0/temporary_nodes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hs3yq0/temporary_nodes/\">[comments]</a></span>",

What started as a hobby project evolved into a library called RapidSolve, which provides a framework for implementing multiple meta-heuristics to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. Over time, we developed and integrated the following algorithms into the library:</p> <ul> <li>(Parallel/recursive) local search</li> <li>Threshold accepting</li> <li>Simulated annealing</li> <li>(Parallel) tabu search</li> </ul> <p>More to come.</p> <p>If your goal is to solve a hard optimization problem, and you see a possibility to explore the solution space by applying modification to a given solution, then this library will help you to quickly apply various meta-heuristics without much effort.</p> <p>Since there is not the &gt;one&lt; algorithm that fits all problems, this is a comfortable way to find the best meta-heuristic for your problem. Give it a try.</p> <p>Combinatorial optimization is an area where Rust really shines. Previously dominated by C++ more and more research team and companies switch to Rust to write optimization algorithms.</p> <p>Crate: <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rapid_solve\">https://crates.io/crates/rapid_solve</a></p> <p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.rs/rapid_solve/\">https://docs.rs/rapid_solve/</a></p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/LeonSering/rapid_solve\">https://github.com/LeonSering/rapid_solve</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TigrAtes\"> /u/TigrAtes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hrug6s/introducing_rapidsolve_a_metaheuristic_library/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hrug6s/introducing_rapidsolve_a_metaheuristic_library/\">[comments]</a></span>",

and won&#8217;t be accessed again soon, so evicting it frees up space for potentially more valuable data.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2

However, other people would prefer a GUI. The reason many programs use text-based configuration (in my opinion) is because its easier to implement and developers generally tend to be more comfortable with it anyway. FOSS developers are less motivated to spend more of their free time implementing a configuration method they don&#39;t even prefer themselves.</p> <p>My idea is this: We now have things like <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\">JSON schema</a>. These schemas can often even be generated from source code, so there is very little effort for developers to provide JSON schemas for their app configuration. A generic configuration GUI would then take 2 inputs: the location of the config file and the JSON schema. From that, it would render a GUI that allows editing the configuration in a way that complies with the schema. (JSON schemas can also validate toml and yaml files as far as I&#39;m aware.)</p> <p>There could also be some community-driven database of apps and their corresponding config file location. With that, users could fuzzy-search for the app they want to configure and never have to worry about the config file location. I just found <a href=\"https://www.schemastore.org/json/\">JSON Schema Store</a> and it looks promising, at least I&#39;m imagining something similar.</p> <p>Is anyone aware of something like this existing? I think it could be a very time-effective way to make Linux and its awesome FOSS ecosystem more accessible to more casual computer users.</p> <p>Also, if you have opinions, inputs, concerns or questions about the idea, I would love to hear them!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/senekor\"> /u/senekor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hrspgv/generic_configuration_gui/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hrspgv/generic_configuration_gui/\">[comments]</a></span>",
