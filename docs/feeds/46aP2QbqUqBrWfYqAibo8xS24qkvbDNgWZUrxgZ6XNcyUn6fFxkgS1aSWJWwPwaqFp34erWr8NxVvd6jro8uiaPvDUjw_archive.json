Since the data is needed for every request (yes 600gb data for every request) I setup nodes to have this directory prior to k8s setup and provide it to pods with hostpath and I am happy with the raw performance.</p> <p>- however, there is one more directory which is not as heavy as the other one but it is still heavy. And this time it is readwrite directory. I had run some experiments. Below are my experiments and problems and thoughts.</p> <ol> <li>testing hostpath local ()<br/></li> <li><p>testing hostpath volume (cloud provider&#39;s elastic volume)</p></li> <li><p>test longhorn local with data locality </p></li> <li><p>test longhorn local without data locality </p></li> <li><p>test longhorn volume with data locality </p></li> <li><p>test longhorn volume without data locality</p></li> </ol> <p>Of course hostpath gives the best performance however I cannot scale across nodes. I am thinking of creating manuel sync etc. or looking for volume sync tool.</p> <p>When I try longhorn I am a bit disappointed. Before, I didn&#39;t need to work on such big datasets and it was okey to just mount with rwx. Even when there is data locality, longhorn causes a performance drop. For example, for a local hostpath I get 1GB/s. When I create a volume with longhorn I get around 100MB/s.</p> <p>Btw, we use cloud only for staging environments for regulatory reasons. I was also disappointed when I learn that elastic volumes are not as fast as local (rookie mistake).</p> <p>To sum up, I want to somehow create and manage volumes that can are rwx and can be mounted to pods across nodes for scalability. Is longhorn the best I can use? That is, is it impossible to achieve something like this?</p> <p>I look forward to anything that helps actually.

Vendor Formats: Cloud providers often modify Kubernetes log formats, making it hard to maintain universal detection rules.</li> <li>CSPs control what&#39;s logged and often keep policies private, leaving teams in the dark.</li> <li>Logs to centralized systems like CloudWatch introduces latency and costs, hindering real-time detection.</li> <li>Gaps in logs and missed detections can obscure attacker techniques like lateral movement or privilege escalation. </li> </ol> <p><strong>How to Overcome These Issues</strong></p> <ol> <li>Use cloud-native logs, VPC flow logs, and dynamic admission controllers for additional insights.</li> <li>Standardize audit log formats for consistent rule application.</li> <li>Wiz&#39;s Kubernetes security stack combines audit logs, network monitoring, and cloud logs for real-time detection.

So naturally I&#39;m thinking about using GitOps and want to try ArgoCD.</p> <p>Currently, I&#39;m installing most stuff manually with helmfile + additional manifests and I&#39;m currently in the &quot;bootstrapping&quot; part of the project, e.g. Installing Cilium as CNI, SealedSecrets to handle secrets, configuring storage, etc.</p> <p>Currently the directory structure in my project is something like this:</p> <pre><code>base ├── 01-cilium │ ├── manifests │ │ ├── bgp-setup.yaml │ │ └── ip-pools.yaml │ ├── helmfile.yaml │ └── values.yaml ├── 02-sealedsecrets │ └── controller.yaml ├── 03-nfs-storage │ ├── helmfile.yaml │ └── values.yaml ├── 04-cert-manager │ ├── ... ├── 05-traefik │ ├── ... ├── 06-argocd │ ├── ... │ ... ... </code></pre> <p>You get the idea.</p> <p>As you can see, there&#39;s some things that have a helmfile, some have manifests only, some have both and I just write in my README how to deploy this, e.g. first <code>helmfile apply -f base/cilium/helmfile.yaml</code>, then <code>kubectl apply -f base/cilium/manifests</code> and so on.</p> <p>On top of that, since I am using SealedSecrets, I need to have the controller running on the Cluster to generate secrets needed for e.g. cert-manager (API-Token for Cloudflare). So that&#39;s a manual step in between so I can push the project to git without it having any unencrypted secrets in it.</p> <p>This feels really clunky and I feel like there should be a much simpler solution. I know I could just write a bash script for this but is this really how the tooling is supposed to be used or am I doing something fundamentally wrong?</p> <p>Also, how do you guys structure your projects and handle stuff like bootstrapping? Do you just use manifests when defining stuff in Code without manual intervention or do you use tools like helmfile? And do you split your git repos between infrastructure projects (deploying core resources and tooling) and application projects?</p> <p>Sorry for asking so many questions but I&#39;m nearly done with getting everything to work but I want to make sure to follow best practices when trying to structure my project and I want to do it now before it gets bigger and restructuring would get annoying...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BrocoLeeOnReddit\"> /u/BrocoLeeOnReddit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hpoekl/deployment_tools_and_gitops_project_structure/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hpoekl/deployment_tools_and_gitops_project_structure/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I wanted to deploy database first and then the other services which are dependent on database. After researching I realized that Kubernetes doesn&#39;t have such feature as it was made to be eventually consistent, so if services are deployed with database, services will keep failing and keep retrying until it connects to database.<br/> I discovered that we can manage dependencies at kustomization level in flux. I used the flux &quot;wait&quot; parameter (<a href=\"https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomizations/#wait\">https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomizations/#wait</a>) that waits for all kustomization resources to get ready by doing healthchecks. So in database kustomization I added &quot;wait&quot; and &quot;dependeOn&quot; in services kustomization so they come up after database is ready. Btw, I have kustomizations for each service and database.

So it means everytime i create a new namespace and deploy my application i have to add dns entry in all worker nodes etc/resolv.conf? I installed busybox for debugging and i found out i cant nslookup for kubernetes.default i get NxError but when i nslookup kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local i get expected result i.e 10.96.0.1. I chatgped and searched everywhere but i cant figure this out please help me</p> <p>Just for further context i m using calico for networking my pod CIDR is 172.24.0.0/16 and my host network is on 192.168.x.x</p> <p>UPDATE: after one of the comment’s recommendations i uninstalled calico and gave cilium a try. I chose 10.244.0.0/24 as my pod cidr and I successfully installed it. Now everything was looking good cilium test -wait showed all good. But when i do cilium connectivity test it deploys a sample app and service for testing the connectivity and it failed at the step below</p> <p>timeout reached waiting for NodePort 192.168.250.114:31457 (cilium-test-1/echo-same-node) (last error: error with exec request (pod=cilium-test-1/client-b65598b6f-knt7l, container=): context deadline exceeded: &quot;&quot;) Please note this is master node and my worker node passed this test successfully. Then i did actual field test of my DNS resolution. And yes it worked everything was resolving nicely. But heres the new problem. Now lets say you deploy a service as NodePort on your any worker nodes. You access it from outside using workernodeip:nodeport it works but when i use masternodeip:nodeport it fails. This should work coz kube-proxy is there it doesn’t matter which node ip you use it should work so any idea guys ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayCupcake9745\"> /u/HolidayCupcake9745 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hnpw8h/kubernetes_dns_resolution_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hnpw8h/kubernetes_dns_resolution_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",
