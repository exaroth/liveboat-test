      "content": "Tesla's annual vehicle sales dropped for the first time in more than a decade despite a year-end push that sent deliveries to a record in the fourth quarter. The Elon Musk-led company sold 1.79 million vehicles last year, it said Thursday, which was slightly less than what it delivered in 2023 and also below analysts’ consensus estimate. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas writes that the miss reflects a “relatively aged product” and more competition. In the broader market, stocks were mixed at the end of a holiday-shortened and turbulent week. European stocks dropped, with miners sliding on concerns about Chinese demand. Stellantis fell as much as 3.8% as some EV models that had previously received US tax credits for electric vehicles were excluded under tougher rules.\n\nToday's guests: Laura Cooper, Nuveen\n--------\n\"The Pulse With Francine Lacqua\" is all about conversations with high profile guests in the beating heart of global business, economics, finance and politics.

Hours later, a deadly explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of President-elect Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas further rattled Americans ringing in 2025. The incidents, which are both being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prompted statements from Trump, President Joe Biden and other senior US officials. Meanwhile in commodities news, European gas prices advanced on the first trading day of the year as the region braced for freezing winter temperatures without a key source of supply.

Musk's growing political influence, including his role as a leading adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, is helping to break down resistance to Starlink's global expansion, with many governments now seeking to attract his business. Starlink has already conquered over 100 countries and territories, offering high-speed internet services and outpacing rivals, with Musk's company using its technological and business advantages to pressure regulators to bend or scrap laws that restrict its operations.

He was 100. Carter died Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia, surrounded by his family, the Carter Center said Sunday in a statement. Public observances are planned in Atlanta and Washington, followed by a private interment in Plains. Tributes poured in from across the world, including from President Joe Biden, who said he’ll order a state funeral in Washington for  Carter. In South Korea, investigators are probing the cause of the worst civil aviation accident ever in the country, focusing on a bird strike and the unusual landing-gear failure in the final moments of the fateful flight that left all but two of the 181 occupants of the Boeing Co. 737 jet dead.\n\nToday's guests: Ellie Henderson, Investec Economist\n--------\n\"The Pulse With Francine Lacqua\" is all about conversations with high profile guests in the beating heart of global business, economics, finance and politics.
