Recently I&#39;ve taken an interest in the doukutsu-rs project, a mostly complete re-implementation Cave Story in Rust.</p> <p>Perusing the code, I noticed the memory safety in the engine&#39;s NPC list is severely lacking. It is very easy to create two mutable references to the same NPC, which my Rust knowledge tells me is a safety violation on the level of &quot;your computer might explode&quot;. Basically, it is forbidden.</p> <p>I wrote a PR to improve the safety. Here is a link, starting at src/game/npc/list.rs: <a href=\"https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs/pull/296/files#diff-2eb94e5c5ef1c61ce68a44bf8fc00ff9a53a292276577e9c40c40d718913cc93\">https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs/pull/296/files#diff-2eb94e5c5ef1c61ce68a44bf8fc00ff9a53a292276577e9c40c40d718913cc93</a></p> <p>Note that the original code uses UnsafeCells to store the NPC&#39;s. The original programmer used this as a somewhat crude way to bypass the borrow checker. There are no guards against taking multiple mutable references to an NPC, and in fact the engine will peek in at mutably borrowed NPC&#39;s to check the &quot;alive&quot; flag.</p> <p>The PR changes the NPC list to use RefCells.</p> <p>On each frame, the game runs through every living NPC and calls a tick function on it. The problem is, the tick function might need to access the NPC list to spawn new NPC&#39;s, kill NPC&#39;s, or change the state of existing NPC&#39;s. This is why NPC&#39;s must be wrapped in Cells. Without cells, borrowing one NPC would cause the entire NPC list to become immutably borrowed and impossible to manipulate.</p> <p>There is an iterator to scan through &quot;alive&quot; NPC&#39;s. Since peeking in at the &quot;alive&quot; flag is impossible while an NPC is borrowed, I made the iterator skip over NPC&#39;s that are borrowed.</p> <p>Before:</p> <p><code>if !npc_ref.cond.alive() {</code></p> <p>After:</p> <p><code>if npc_ref.try_borrow().is_ok_and(|npc_ref| !npc_ref.cond.alive()) {</code></p> <p>The big problem is, there are hundreds of objects in the game and it&#39;s hard to tell if some NPC logic relies on being able to view NPC that is already borrowed. This PR could cause subtle logic errors, which is why I&#39;ve labeled it &quot;do not merge&quot;.</p> <p>I thought about overhauling the NPC tick logic so instead of calling &quot;tick(&amp;mut self, ...)&quot; on the object, it becomes &quot;tick(self_: &amp;RefCell&lt;NPC&gt;&quot;. Then, the NPC logic could drop all its borrows before accessing the NPC list. However, the notion of filling the NPC logic with &quot;borrow()&quot; and &quot;borrow_mut()&quot; is daunting.</p> <p>So I&#39;m asking for advice. What do Rustaceans think of my approach? Is there a better solution I&#39;m missing? How would other Rust programmers tackle this problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/beholdnec\"> /u/beholdnec </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hnx9nm/improving_safety_in_doukutsurs_npc_list_request/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hnx9nm/improving_safety_in_doukutsurs_npc_list_request/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I recently created a parameter parser for Axum that aims to bring Ruby on Rails-like parameter handling to Rust: <a href=\"https://github.com/cpunion/axum-params\">https://github.com/cpunion/axum-params</a></p> <h2>Motivation</h2> <p>I found myself writing significantly more code in Rust compared to Rails for similar functionality. My Rust controllers were often several times longer, especially when handling file uploads and complex parameter structures. I wanted to streamline this.</p> <h2>What it does</h2> <p>The library provides a Rails-inspired parameter parser that: - Unifies handling of Query/Path/Form/JSON/Multipart parameters - Supports complex tree-like data structures - Handles multiple file objects efficiently - Allows multiple parameter types in a single controller - Currently implements parameter parsing for Axum</p> <h2>Context</h2> <p>While Axum&#39;s extractors are efficient, they have limitations - like not being able to use JSON and Multipart simultaneously since they both consume the request body. File upload handling can also be cumbersome.</p> <h2>Technical Journey</h2> <p>Following my <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hl3wxy/how_to_implement_custom_deserialization_for_a/\">previous post</a>, I explored various approaches through Reddit, Stack Overflow, and the Rust Discord community. The main challenge was that we can&#39;t directly deserialize a <code>tokio::fs::File</code> into struct fields. The compromise was to create a pseudo-file object that deserializes temporary file paths and provides an <code>open</code> method to access the file.</p> <h2>Current Limitations</h2> <ol> <li>Due to the indirect file object deserialization, I added a <code>files</code> field in the Params object for automatic cleanup of temporary files. Users need to include an unused &quot;_&quot; parameter in declarations, which feels inelegant.</li> <li>As my first side project in Rust and first published crate, the codebase is partially AI-generated with manual corrections. While functional, I&#39;m uncertain about potential issues.</li> <li>Documentation is currently minimal. I&#39;m curious if others face similar needs and would be interested in collaborating on improvements.</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;d greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions for improvements, or interest in contributing to the project. Let me know if you&#39;ve faced similar challenges or have ideas for better solutions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Organic_Savings_6128\"> /u/Organic_Savings_6128 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hnwbut/i_built_a_railslike_parameter_parser_for_axum/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hnwbut/i_built_a_railslike_parameter_parser_for_axum/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It never happened to me, I never got an error from <code>cargo</code> saying that crate X and Y are incompatible for this reason. 3) Is there any eyes on making this more flexible? Meaning, attempting to join different major crate versions and see if the libraries still build, because after all we&#39;re still building all the source code.</p> <p>Not trying to solve any problem. I&#39;m just curious.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/deavidsedice\"> /u/deavidsedice </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hmshtr/cross_crate_dependencies_how_does_rust_avoid/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hmshtr/cross_crate_dependencies_how_does_rust_avoid/\">[comments]</a></span>",
