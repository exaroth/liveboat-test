But to build the new capital, thousands of indigenous families were evicted from ancestral forest lands—lands in many cases given to private investors in Nusantra. And there is no court in Indonesia that will change that—because the laws that allow these evictions remain in force.  The same method has been used for decades to clear forest lands for wide-scale agriculture—such as the palm oil industry and for mining interests. The practice is the result of 150 years of colonial legacy and dictatorship, and it is still the law of the land today. Disputes over land use have dramatically expanded as the country sought to boost economic activity under President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo who left office in October of 2024. \n\nSiapa Tanggung Biaya Pembangunan? \nBom Waktu Konflik Lahan di Indonesia\n \nIbu kota Nusantara seharusnya menerangi arah pembangunan Indonesia di masa depan: berkelanjutan, progresif, dan dipenuhi peluang baru. Namun, untuk membangun ibu kota baru, ribuan masyarakat adat digusur dari tanah leluhur—yang dalam banyak kasus diserahkan kepada investor swasta. Upaya hukum acap tidak mampu menghentikan penyerobotan lahan atau penggusuran karena konstitusi yang menguatkan klaim pemerintah. Metode yang sama telah digunakan selama beberapa dekade demi membuka lahan hutan untuk pertanian berskala besar, seperti industri kelapa sawit, atau pertambangan. Praktik ini merupakan warisan dari 150 tahun kekuasaan kolonial dan kediktatoran, yang hingga kini masih menciptakan sengketa demi sengketa. Konflik penggunaan lahan telah meluas secara dramatis, ketika pemerintah di Jakarta belakangan meningkatkan aktivitas ekonomi di bawah Presiden Joko “Jokowi” Widodo yang lengser pada Oktober 2024.\n\nLaporan ini adalah episode kedua dalam seri Inside Asian Conflicts milik DW.\n\nThis is the second espisode in DW’s Insidea Asian Conflicts series. \n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n01:48 Nusantra, Indonesia’s Future? \n04:54 Growth of Land Disputes under Jokowi \n08:05 Palm Oil Plantations & Displacements \n09:40 Mining: Maximum Profit and Minimum Liability \n12:01 Dutch Colonial Legacy of Dispossesion \n15:15 Way Forward? \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#indonesia #InsideAsianConflicts",

      "content": "Russia has so far resisted pressure from Azerbaijan to admit responsibility for the plane crash in Kazakhstan. Since Wednesday, the Kremlin has refused to comment on claims that a Russian missile caused the crash.\n\nTwo days after an Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashed in Aktau, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan appears to be increasing pressure on Russia. Although an investigation is still underway in Kazakhstan, preliminary results have been leaked to the press. With an accidental Russian air defense missile strike now the leading theory behind the crash, more and more Azerbaijani officials are calling on Russia to admit responsibility.\n\nThe Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 crashed on Wednesday in a field near Aktau, in western Kazakhstan. Of the 67 passengers onboard, 38 died and 29 were hospitalized, some with severe injuries. The plane wasn't supposed to land in Aktau. The aircraft had taken off from Baku, in Azerbaijan, on Wednesday morning and was due to land in Grozny, Russia, an area that has recently been heavily targeted by Ukrainian drones, when something happened to it that some survivors later described as a collision with a bird. Videos of the emergency landing near Aktau show the plane gaining altitude, then sharply descending before crashing to the ground and catching fire. Other videos showed the wrecked aircraft lying in the field. Apart from the damage caused by the crash, the videos show the fuselage riddled with small holes. Some experts, including those DW spoke to, said these holes may be attributed to a strike by Russia's anti-aircraft systems.\n\nInvestigation underway\nKazakhstan has launched an investigation into the causes of the incident. An investigative commission established by the country's prime minister will include the participation of, among others, a deputy prime minister and the leadership of several ministries. The commission is said to be collaborating with Azerbaijan. As of Friday evening local time, no details of the investigation have been announced by any government official. Kazakhstan's parliamentary speaker, Maulen Ashimbayev, said Thursday investigators didn't yet know what had caused the tragedy. He also called the theory of a Russian anti-aircraft system strike speculation. \"Spreading such allegations is not right and unethical,\" he said. This reaction corresponds with the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He has so far refused to comment on the allegations about the Russian air defense system strike. Instead, he has called on the parties to wait until the investigation in Kazakhstan is completed.\n\nMeanwhile, Azerbaijan Airlines has suspended several flights from Baku to seven cities in Russia starting December 28. These are areas at risk of Ukrainian drone attacks and where Russian air defense systems are active. In an official statement, the airline said the plane that crashed on Wednesday experienced \"external physical and technical interference.\" After growing signs of irritation on the Azerbaijani side went public, Russian aviation authorities released more details about the circumstances leading up to the plane crash. The head of Russia's civil aviation authority, Dmitry Yadrov, said Friday that the so-called Carpet plan had been implemented before the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash due to a Ukrainian drone attack. The plan means that the airport in Grozny was closed for departures and arrivals and all aircraft were required to leave the area. According to Yadrov, the pilots unsuccessfully attempted to land in Grozny twice. He mentioned that the area was covered in dense fog. The crew then allegedly refused to consider alternative landing options in Russia and flew to Aktau, before the plane crashed in the coastal area.\n\nPro-Kremlin bloggers admit a Russian strike\nWhile Russian state-run media appear keen to avoid mentioning the possibility of a Russian missile hitting the plane, pro-Kremlin military bloggers on Telegram seem to have no doubts about what happened. The most popular military Telegram channels such as Rybar, Yuri Podolyaka and Alex Parker write that the Russian anti-aircraft system strike seems to be the most likely cause of the crash. \"But I am sure that the Chechens will manage to avoid responsibility, and no one will be punished,\" a post on the Alex Parker channel reads.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

He accused Russia of throwing them into battle with quote \"minimal protection\". Pyongyang has sent an estimated 11,000 troops to support the Russian armed forces. \n\nNorth Koreans are reportedly being deployed in the Kursk region - the Russian territory captured by Ukraine over the summer. US officials say North Korean forces are suffering \"mass casualties\" there on the front lines, with around a thousand soldiers killed or wounded this past week alone.\n\nHere's Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking about the North Korean soldiers captured by Ukraine: ''The Russians send them into assaults with minimal protection. Today, there were reports about several soldiers from North Korea. Our soldiers managed to capture them, but they were very seriously wounded and could not be revived. This is one of the manifestations of the madness that dictatorships are capable of. The Korean people should not lose their people in battles in Europe. And this can be influenced by Korea's neighbors, particularly China. If China is sincere in its statements that the war should not expand, appropriate influence on Pyongyang is needed.''\n_\nJenny Town is a Senior Fellow at the US think tank Stimson Center and the Director of Stimson’s 38 North Program which provides analysis of events in and around North Korea.\n\nEdward Howell is a lecturer in International Relations at the University of Oxford and an expert on Korea.\n\n00:00 Who are the the troops N.
