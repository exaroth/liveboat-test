At first i was sceptical, i wasnt sure if i could do the same stuff i used to do on Windows, i wasnt sure if i could play the games i played on Windows. Then the Steam Deck arrived and it opened my eyes. I quickly chose a Distro that looked nice to me, and had a decent amount of users. The switch was painless and i had absolutely no problems, thanks to THIS sub! All the people here have been super nice and helpful, even when tackled with super beginner noob questions.</p> <p>Thats it!

I understand that it&#39;s cross-platform and GPU-accelerated. But what I mean is –– in the real world, what is the typical developer gaining by switching to this terminal from, say, Alacritty? What&#39;s the value proposition? Are there things Ghostty can do that other terminals can&#39;t? Do those things matter? Do any of these Rust/Zig/Go &quot;high-performance&quot; terminal emulators actually matter for the regular-brained developer?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jsonathan\"> /u/jsonathan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn700x/what_are_the_meaningful_differences_between/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn700x/what_are_the_meaningful_differences_between/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How to know what I should be donating to be Linux?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn43zm/how_to_know_what_i_should_be_donating_to_be_linux/","date":1735264656,"author":"/u/NoCSForYou","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ive always been confused by this.

Obviously those programs need funding too.</p> <p>It shouldn&#39;t just be the front end packages that get all the funding, the end stuff needs finding too. </p> <p>I can have about 1000 packages on my system and it&#39;s going to be logistically difficult to donate 1/1000 of 200$. I can donate to the front end packages but do they distribute the funding to their dev/make/runtime dependency packages? </p> <p>Perhaps bash is a dependency for about half my programs. Does that mean bash should get more money than all other programs? </p> <p>I don&#39;t know what to do. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoCSForYou\"> /u/NoCSForYou </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn43zm/how_to_know_what_i_should_be_donating_to_be_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn43zm/how_to_know_what_i_should_be_donating_to_be_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Tuifoop, a terminal game in Bash","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn2krz/tuifoop_a_terminal_game_in_bash/","date":1735259958,"author":"/u/christos_71","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/christos_71\"> /u/christos_71 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ngcbmsapea9e1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hn2krz/tuifoop_a_terminal_game_in_bash/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Performance Benefits Of Linux 6.12 LTS Over Linux 6.6 LTS","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmzql2/the_performance_benefits_of_linux_612_lts_over/","date":1735251808,"author":"/u/BinkReddit","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BinkReddit\"> /u/BinkReddit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-66-612-lts\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmzql2/the_performance_benefits_of_linux_612_lts_over/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Ghostty terminal is out!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmxpg1/ghostty_terminal_is_out/","date":1735246304,"author":"/u/TheTwelveYearOld","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTwelveYearOld\"> /u/TheTwelveYearOld </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ghostty.org/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hmxpg1/ghostty_terminal_is_out/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
