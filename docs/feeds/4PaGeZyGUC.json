      "content": "Temperate forests stretch across Europe from Brittany to the Urals. They consist mainly of deciduous trees. One tree has a very special role to play: the oak.\n\nFor the Celts, the oak symbolised the connection between the spirits of heaven and earth. In fact, the tree is perfectly adapted to the changing seasons: In autumn it loses its leaves, in winter it rests under a blanket of snow and in spring it begins to sprout anew. Its fruits are a tasty treat for wood mice, wild boar, squirrels and jays, all of which help to spread the oak seeds. High in the branches, green woodpeckers and bats thank the tree for its hospitality by ridding it of the parasites that prey on its wood and leaves.\n\nThe shy lynx also serves the oak well, defending it from the deer and ibex that love to nibble on its shoots. Beneath the ground, the oak lives in symbiosis with fungi, which provide it with vital nutrients. Ecologists, biologists and fungal researchers explain the connections between these fascinating interactions. The secret of the success of the highly resilient temperate forests lies in their biodiversity. Unfortunately, they are increasingly being replaced by pure conifer plantations, which meet the demands of the highly standardized timber industry but deplete the soil, causing numerous species to migrate. In view of industrial timber construction practices and the expansion of urban centers, the question arises: is the oak really as immortal as people claim?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "Luke Tomes travels to the Royal Armouries in Leeds to fire some of the most iconic weapons of the Second World War belonging to the British Army.\n\nAs always he is joined by Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson who talks him through the history of all the pistols, rifles and machine guns employed in the conflict.\n\nFirst up is the Webley Revolver Mk VI, first introduced during the stalemate of static and bloody trench warfare in 1915. Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley‚Äôs returning to front line service in the conflict.\n\nSecond is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.\n\nThird up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.\n\nLast but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren‚Äôs box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition. \n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

The mission put a man on the moon for the very first time, winning the Space Race for the United States.  \n\nThe rocket that made it possible was Saturn V. As tall as a 36-story building, it was the most powerful that had ever flown, symbolising American technological dominance during the Cold War. \n\nAnd yet, the man who designed it had a dark past. During the Second World War, he had been at the forefront of the Nazi Secret Weapons programme, designing weapons which cost thousands of lives. His name was Werner von Braun.\n\n*Note* The shots used at 3:27 are from the German Science Fiction film ‚ÄúThe woman in the moon‚Äù (Fritz Lang, 1927) This film (used for illustrative purposes in the video) was a source of inspiration for many early rocket scientists, and it‚Äôs technical director Herman Oberth would heavily influence von Braun and his work. \n\nLearn more about Lewis' work at lewisbush.com\nYou can order his book on Werner von Braun, Depravity's Rainbow, here: shop.lewisbush.com\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video: https://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_GAE5zrAe\n\n\"Werner von Braun\" Written and performed by Tom Lehrer - Public Domain\n\nAttributions:\nBundesarchiv, Bild 146-1978-Anh.024-03 / CC-BY-SA 3.0\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nx.com/I_W_M\ninstagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nfacebook.com/iwm.london",

A huge magma chamber lies dormant beneath the Earth's crust. An eruption would have catastrophic consequences.\n\nIf an eruption does occur, it‚Äôll be a race against time. So, with the help of modern measuring techniques, researchers are seeking to identify early warning signs. If they can better understand the processes taking place inside the Earth, it‚Äôll help them predict an eruption. This, in turn, would allow affected areas to be evacuated in time. \n\nIn the past 2.1 million years, the Yellowstone Supervolcano has erupted three times - most recently, some 600,000 years ago.

      "content": "While the German economy navigates troubled waters, the lives of the rich continue on unaffected. This film takes a look into the largely closed-off world of the country's millionaires and billionaires - and at how the wealthy see themselves and their privileged lifestyles.\n\nWe talk to the CEO of a luxury watchmaker who says German industry suffers from overregulation, with insufficient rewards for taking risks. A well-off building contractor from Dusseldorf, on the other hand, explains how most of the country's millionaires acquire their wealth not from entrepreneurship, but from inheritance. He wants to see a drastic rise in tax rates for the rich, and the proceeds invested where they're needed, e.g. in infrastructure and education.\n\nThis documentary also shows life at the Salem boarding school, where the wealthy pay tens of thousands of euros a year to send their children to school. For many, their education includes learning to take on the responsibility involved in later running their family-run businesses.\n\nThe superrich live longer and enjoy special tax benefits. The suspension of a wealth tax in 1997 has reportedly cost the German state ‚Ç¨380 billion in lost revenues. With the country facing a financial crisis, will its most prosperous individuals live up to their responsibilities that come with privileged financial power?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They're a social hub that helps create a sense of community.\n\nIn Germany, people from all walks of life often stop by local pubs, convenience stores, kiosks, and corner shops as part of their daily routine. These places are becoming increasingly vital for personal interaction in a society where many feel isolated and lonely. How can these social hubs help bridge divides and foster a sense of community? What challenges do they face? Jana Oertel and Bettina Stehk√§mper explored Berlin‚Äôs vibrant convenience store culture and visited traditional kiosks typical of the Ruhr region ‚Äî establishments that serve as much more than places to shop and take care of errand. Their journey also took them to the eastern German town of Wechmar, where a group of volunteers saved a local pub from closure. Now, it serves as a community hub, bringing people together for special monthly pub evenings ‚Äî a testament to the role such spaces can play in strengthening social bonds.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #reporter\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

One of his brothers died in an Assad torture prison and before he fled, Omar himself spent three months in one of the regime's notorious prison camps.

      "content": "In western Ukraine, close to the borders of Slovakia and Poland, lies the village of Stuzhytsia. The name can be roughly translated as \"cold place.\" The film tells the story of three women: the farmer Hanna, the postwoman Maria and the biologist Nelya.\n\nIn the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, the three protagonists must grapple with their social reality - and loneliness. Very few young people live here, but the elderly women are deeply rooted to their village and its surroundings. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.\n\nIn a tiny kitchen, Hanna shares her feelings of loneliness with the filmmakers, who she says remind her of her deceased sons. At the village post office, post woman Maria has neither stamps nor heating, but customers are warmed with liquor and songs. Somewhere in the woods and caves, biologist Nelya looks for the animal droppings that are a treasure to her. The film portrays an unknown place at the heart of Europe, where people make a daily choice - stay or leave?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs have been saving all year about immortality, redshifting photons, altering the laws of physics, and more!\n\nIs humanity destined to merge with technology, or will we cling to our biological roots? Gary questions whether we'll resist becoming hybrids when our tech already fits in the palm of our hands, while Chuck dreams of a neural chip to help humanity overcome its neurochemical flaws. But would you let Elon implant it?\n\nNext, they reflect on the evolution of flight, recalling the rapid progress from the Wright brothers to supersonic speeds. Why did humanity‚Äôs urge to fly faster fade? Turns out, impatience drives innovation‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. What happens to a photon‚Äôs energy as it redshifts toward infinity at the universe‚Äôs edge? Then, if given the power to bend the laws of physics, what would you change? We discuss what changing Planck‚Äôs constant would do to the universe. \n\nWas human civilization contingent on fossil fuels? Could we have reached the moon in the 1700s without them? They discuss how war has often set humanity back, even as energy consumption drives progress. Chuck raises a powerful question: What if enlightenment, not survival, was humanity‚Äôs ultimate motivator?\n\nCould alien civilizations have abandoned biology to live as AI in virtual worlds, stuck in a self-made \"Matrix\"? We also examine the limits of thermodynamics: Could entropy prevent us from living forever, or does being an open system offer a loophole?\n\nFinally, we explore humanity‚Äôs potential to communicate with alien life. Could we use geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, to prove intelligence? Or might extraterrestrials miss the message entirely? Could advanced alien civilizations be humming data centers, living in their \"Matrix\"? Can entropy be defied to achieve immortality? And what geometric proof might convince aliens of our intelligence?\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Chuck and Gary‚Äôs Burning Questions\n01:43 - Are We Going to Merge with Machine?\n06:41 - Redshifting to Infinity\n07:59 - If You Could Change Physics\n12:28 - Could We Have Gone to the Moon in 1700? \n21:45 - AI & Energy\n24:51 - How We Use Electrons as a Wave\n28:41 - Are The Aliens Trapped in the Matrix?\n33:19 - Does Physics Prevent Us From Living Forever? \n36:07 - Communicating with Aliens\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

      "content": "All around the world, entrepreneurs and scientists are looking for a way out of factory farming. They‚Äôre concerned by the issue of animal welfare. But a primary motive is the ecological impact of industrial livestock farming.\n\nIndustrial livestock farming is responsible for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It also requires huge amounts of land and water and is thought to be contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. This is why more and more scientists and entrepreneurs are conducting research on alternatives to conventional meat production.\n\nIn California, Joshua Tetrick is working on a method of growing meat in a bioreactor. He multiplies the muscle cells of chickens in huge tanks and cultivates them with plant-based nutrients. The resulting cell pulp is molded into fibrous meat with the help of a plant scaffold. A kilo still costs many hundreds of dollars. But Joshua Tetrick hopes that production can be scaled up to a globally relevant level. After all, with ‚ÄòGood Meat‚Äô he was one of the first two companies in the USA to receive a license for cultured meat.\n\nAt the University of California, Alison Van Eenennaam is trying to make meat production more efficient.  Using the gene editing tool CRISPR she‚Äôs altered the genetic make-up of a cow so that its offspring are exclusively male. This is a great advantage, as male calves grow faster and consume fewer resources than female calves to produce the same amount of meat - thereby reducing the carbon footprint of livestock farming. \n\nFor Pasi Vainikka from ‚ÄòSolar Foods‚Äô in Helsinki, these are all just intermediate steps on the way to a truly sustainable future food: he‚Äôs cultivating a whole new category of food in gigantic fermenters: Bacteria that are fed with CO2 and hydrogen and blended to create a product called ‚ÄòSolein‚Äô. A flavorless, protein-rich basic ingredient that can replace eggs and milk in practically all foods.\n\nScience journalist Ingolf Baur meets some of the researchers and entrepreneurs seeking alternatives to industrial livestock farming around the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the last decade of my career however, I have been focusing much more on experience design - and engaging people and communities away from technology. I have been studying how to engage people and draw them into a community or conversation - curating every detail across multiple touchpoints including what people see, hear, smell, taste‚Äìand above else‚Äìfeel.\n\nExperience design is critical to designing digital experiences and innovative new products. But it can also be used to explore better workplace policies, better experiences for employees, and even shape creative career paths.\n\nTogether, we‚Äôll explore how experience designers are able to explore new ways of addressing the problems their people face.

It was undoubtedly a divisive year both within and along borders. The war in Ukraine is now in its third year. Syrian rebels toppled the Assad regime after years of fighting. South Korea erupted into chaos after the prime minister declared martial law and was subsequently impeached. In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. \n\nDespite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. \n\n2024 had much of the world voting for change. Onward, to 2025 where we will find out what it means.\n\nCorrection: At 4:16 we show the wrong clip of Pope Francis. Our clip shows him visiting Myanmar in 2017 ‚Äî we meant to include a clip from his 2024 visit to Indonesia. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
